            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Medjil, means ‘accurate’ in the <i>Whadjuk Noongar</i> language.</p>
            <p>The Medjil portal was developed by <a href="https://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/">Landgate</a> (the Western
               Australian Land Information Authority) in collaboration with the <a
                  href="https://www.icsm.gov.au" />Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping</a> (ICSM)
               jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>The portal allows the calibration of the following:</p>
            <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
               <li>EDM Instrumentation using standardised EDM Baselines</li>
               <li>EDM Baselines using standardised instruments</li>
               <li>Barcode staff using staff calibration range facility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The purpose of calibrating the EDM Instrumentation (EDMI) is to establish the legal traceability of a user's
               instrument to the national standard of length provided by the National Measurement Institute (NMI). This is
               accomplished by determining the Instrument Correction and its uncertainty through a survey procedure
               conducted at a certified EDM Baseline. The certification of EDM Baselines are maintained by individual
               States and Territories.</p>
            <p>The certification (or calibration) of EDM baselines establishes updated (or improved) distances between their
               pillars. The calibration of an EDMI provides distance correction specific to that instrumentation which are
               to be applied to measurements taken using that instrumentation (eg. EDM and prism). EDM Baselines and EDMI
               calibration should be conducted on a regular basis. Check your legislative requirements in your State and
               Territory for compliance.</p>
            <p>The Medjil portal provides tools and reports for Levelling Staff, EDM Baseline and EDMI calibration
               procedures. Please refer to the specific guides that provide field calibration instructions.</p>
            <p>This document includes reference information, encompassing mathematical equations, procedures, algorithms,
               and computations utilized by the Medjil portal. The calibration procedures are based on the following

            <div id="Chapter_2_1">
               <h3>2.1 EDM Baseline designs</h3>
            
               <p>Since their introduction, the use of EDM Baseline has been the preferred calibration method for EDM
                  instrumentation. There are three different EDM Baseline designs:</p>
               <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
                     <li>Heerbrugg Design</li>
                     <li>Aarau Design</li>
                     <li>Hobart Design</li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  Each EDM Baseline design aims to achieve an equal distribution of measured distances between the shortest and
                     longest lines without any repetitions. They also allow EDMI calibration, with or without known distances
                     (certified baseline distances), except for the Hobart design, which requires the distances to be known
                     beforehand. Most EDM baseline designs aim to accommodate a variety of EDM instrument unit lengths. A
                     detailed explanation of baseline design concepts is beyond the scope of this manual. For comprehensive
                     information on baseline design, please refer to the book 'Electronic Distance Measurement' by J.M. Rueger.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The current version of Medjil requires baseline distances to be known for all types of baselines to perform
                     EDMI calibration. This approach is crucial for ensuring distance traceability to the national standard.
                     Therefore, EDM Baselines must first be calibrated using NMI-certified instrument to determine the certified
                     distances before proceeding with EDMI calibration. An additional module could potentially be developed to
                     enable EDMI calibration without known distances. However, it is important to note that such calibrations
                     cannot be certified under the NMI Act, and the EDMI distances obtained in this manner are not legally
                     traceable to the national standard. For Medjil development and contribution, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Landgate/Medjil">GitHub</a>repository.

               <p>Deriving two observation equations not only ensures that distances remain non-negative but also enhances the
                     flexibility of the EDM Baseline survey:</p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>j</sub> = Distance from the first pillar to pillar 'j'. Distance corrected for the

               <p>Let's consider the following example baseline, comprising four pillars:</p>
               <img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Medjil_Technical_Manual\Picture_1_1.png"
                  alt="Example of EDM Baseline">

               <br>
               <p>A set of linear observation equations can be formulated based on Eq. 1.1 and Eq. 1.2 as follows:</p>

                  \begin{matrix}D_{12}=&{+X}_2&&&-zpc\\D_{13}=&&{+X}_3&&-zpc\\D_{14}=&&&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{21}=&{+X}_2&&&-zpc\\D_{23}=&-X_2&+X_3&&-zpc\\D_{24}=&-X_2&&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{31}=&&+X_3&&-zpc\\D_{32}=&-X_2&{+X}_3&&-zpc\\D_{34}=&&-X_3&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{41}=&&&+X_4&-zpc\\D_{42}=&-X_2&&+X_4&-zpc\\D_{43}=&&-X_3&+X_4&-zpc\\\end{matrix}\

               <p>In matrix notation, the observation equations can be represented as D = AX:</p>
               <div>$$

               <p>Where:</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;D<sub>ij</sub> = Measured distance between pillars i and j (vector of the observations)

               <p>This approach eliminates the need to provide approximate distances between pillars. In accordance
                  with Section (5), the observations, along with their a-priori uncertainties (P), undergo a least
                  squares adjustment to obtain the estimated certified distances d<sub>x</sub>, the zpc value, and the

               <h3>2.4 Inter-pillar distances survey</h3>
               <img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Medjil_Technical_Manual\Picture_1_3.png"
                  alt="Inter-pillar distances survey">
               <p>To calibrate an EDM baseline, a series of inter-pillar distance measurements (surveys) are necessary,
                  which should include atmospheric observations of the conditions during the during measuring of each
                  survey distance. Medjil mandates that all instrumentation used in the survey must be calibrated and
                  possess a current certificate stating the uncertainty of the instrument readings and the calibration
                  corrections that can be applied. The uncertainty of instrument readings plays a crucial role in
                  propagating uncertainties for the inter-pillar distance survey.</p>
               <p>The distance observations are assumed to be slope distances that have not been corrected for the
                  height of instrument or height of targets. Applying atmospheric corrections by entering these into
                  the instrument is optional but Medjil requires temperature, pressure and humidity for every distance
                  measurement even if this has been entered into the instrument. These values are used for estimating
                  the propagation of uncertainty as well as the optional applying of atmospheric corrections when no
                  correction was applied by the instrument during the survey.</p>
               <p>It is recommended each distance (bay) d<sub>ij</sub> (where i = from_pillar; j = to_pillar) should be
                  measured four times. However, Medjil allows the number of repeat measurements to vary between bays
                  and between surveys. The pillar survey data is to be provided in an ASCII file and must contain the
                  following fields:</p>

               <h3>2.5 Pillar offsets survey</h3>
               <p>The pillar offset survey determines the offset of each pillar from the alignment of the first (1) and
                  last pillar (n). Medjil performs the required reduction of observations during the EDM Baseline
                  calibration process. Distances observed from every pillar of the baseline can be included in the
                  calculation of the pillar offset if the survey setup includes measurements to pillar 1 and pillar n.

                  every pillar setup that included observations to pillar 1 and pillar n. Medjil computes the average
                  pillar offset and standard deviation redundancy of observations measured from multiple pillars.
                  These are used for a-priori estimation of uncertainties and the reduction of EDM measured distances
                  to the reference alignment and height. Table 4.4 demonstrates an example set of pillar offsets.</p>

            <h2>2. About the Boya Staff Calibration Range</h2>
            
            <p> The Landgate barcode staff calibration range is located at the Land Surveyors Licensing Board's examination site at Boya and consists of 2 observing pillars and a series of 21 stainless steel pins set in a solid granite outcrop in a semi-arc rounding the two observing pillars.
            </p>
    
            <p> The two observing pillars were first constructed beside a large piece of sloping granite which had the required 4 metres of height difference between top and bottom. The highest pillar is set at a comfortable observing height and the lowest a metre lower and closer to the rock and range. 
            </p>
    
            <p>The pins were glued into drilled holes in the granite while the observing pillars were concreted deep into the ground to ensure their stability. With the 3 metre invar staff, it was possible to observe from Pin 1 to 15 from the high pillar and from Pin 7 to Pin 21 from the lower pillar
