            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>We adopted the word 'Medjil' from <i>Whadjuk Noongar</i> language, which means ‘accurate’ as the name for the survey instrumentation calibration portal.</p>
            <p>The Medjil portal was developed by <a href="https://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/">Landgate</a> (the Western
               Australian Land Information Authority) in collaboration with the <a
                  href="https://www.icsm.gov.au" />Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping</a> (ICSM)
               jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>The portal allows the calibration of the following:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>EDM Instrumentation using standardised EDM Baselines</li>
               <li>EDM Baselines using standardised instruments</li>
               <li>Barcode staff using staff calibration range facility (refer to Staff Calibration manual for details)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The purpose of calibrating the EDM Instrumentation (EDMI) is to establish the legal traceability of a
               user's
               instrument to the national standard of length provided by the National Measurement Institute (NMI). This
               is
               accomplished by determining the Instrument Correction and its uncertainty through a survey procedure
               conducted at a certified EDM Baseline. The certification of EDM Baselines are maintained by individual
               States and Territories.</p>
            <p>The certification (or calibration) of EDM baselines establishes updated (or improved) distances between
               their
               pillars. The calibration of an EDMI provides distance correction specific to that instrumentation which
               are
               to be applied to measurements taken using that instrumentation (eg. EDM and prism). EDM Baselines and
               EDMI
               calibration should be conducted on a regular basis. Check your legislative requirements in your State and
               Territory for compliance.</p>
            <p>The Medjil portal provides tools and reports for Levelling Staff, EDM Baseline and EDMI calibration
               procedures. Please refer to the specific guides that provide field calibration instructions.</p>
            <p>This document includes reference information, encompassing mathematical equations, procedures,
               algorithms,
               and computations utilized by the Medjil portal. The calibration procedures are based on the following

            <div id="EDMI-Chapter2_1">
               <h3>2.1 EDM Baseline designs</h3>

               <p>Since their introduction, the use of EDM Baseline has been the preferred calibration method for EDM
                  instrumentation. There are three different EDM Baseline designs:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Heerbrugg Design</li>
                  <li>Aarau Design</li>
                  <li>Hobart Design</li>
               </ul>
               <br>
               <p>Each EDM Baseline design aims to achieve an equal distribution of measured distances between the
                  shortest and
                  longest lines without any repetitions. They also allow EDMI calibration, with or without known
                  distances
                  (certified baseline distances), except for the Hobart design, which requires the distances to be known
                  beforehand. Most EDM baseline designs aim to accommodate a variety of EDM instrument unit lengths. A
                  detailed explanation of baseline design concepts is beyond the scope of this manual. For comprehensive
                  information on baseline design, please refer to the book 'Electronic Distance Measurement' by J.M.
                  Rueger.
               </p>
               <p>The current version of Medjil requires baseline distances to be known for all types of baselines to
                  perform
                  EDMI calibration. This approach is crucial for ensuring distance traceability to the national
                  standard.
                  Therefore, EDM Baselines must first be calibrated using NMI-certified instrument to determine the
                  certified
                  distances before proceeding with EDMI calibration. An additional module could potentially be developed
                  to
                  enable EDMI calibration without known distances. However, it is important to note that such
                  calibrations
                  cannot be certified under the NMI Act, and the EDMI distances obtained in this manner are not legally
                  traceable to the national standard. For Medjil development and contribution, please refer to the <a

                  enhances the

                  alt="Inter-pillar distances survey">
               <p>To calibrate an EDM baseline, a series of inter-pillar distance measurements (surveys) are
                  necessary,
                  which should include atmospheric observations of the conditions during the during measuring of each
                  survey distance. Medjil mandates that all instrumentation used in the survey must be calibrated and
                  possess a current certificate stating the uncertainty of the instrument readings and the
                  calibration
                  corrections that can be applied. The uncertainty of instrument readings plays a crucial role in
                  propagating uncertainties for the inter-pillar distance survey.</p>
               <p>The distance observations are assumed to be slope distances that have not been corrected for the
                  height of instrument or height of targets. Applying atmospheric corrections by entering these into
                  the instrument is optional but Medjil requires temperature, pressure and humidity for every
                  distance
                  measurement even if this has been entered into the instrument. These values are used for estimating
                  the propagation of uncertainty as well as the optional applying of atmospheric corrections when no
                  correction was applied by the instrument during the survey.</p>
               <p>It is recommended each distance (bay) d<sub>ij</sub> (where i = from_pillar; j = to_pillar) should
                  be
                  measured four times. However, Medjil allows the number of repeat measurements to vary between bays
                  and between surveys. The pillar survey data is to be provided in an ASCII file and must contain the
                  following fields:</p>

                  calculation of the pillar offset if the survey setup includes measurements to pillar 1 and pillar
                  n.

               <p>As the instrument moves between pillars, pillar 1 and pillar n are observed in each setup. This

                  from
                  every pillar setup that included observations to pillar 1 and pillar n. Medjil computes the average
                  pillar offset and standard deviation redundancy of observations measured from multiple pillars.
                  These are used for a-priori estimation of uncertainties and the reduction of EDM measured distances

                        deviations
                        equal to zero).
                        <br>Linear regression is used on the average ‘slope distance’ and ‘standard deviation’ to derive

                  <h4>5.2.2 Custom uncertainty budgets</h4>
                  <p>The Medjil ‘Default’ uncertainty budget is used during the calibration computation, and it
                     encompasses
                     typical sources of uncertainty along with their corresponding values. These values are obtained
                     from the
                     Instrument Register or are derived from survey data during computation.
                  <p>Medjil also permits the creation of a 'Custom' (company-specific) uncertainty budget that can be
                     used
                     instead of the 'Default' sources of uncertainty. This 'Custom' uncertainty budget can be
                     established by
                     combining the following three uncertainty sources and values: (a) stored in the 'Instrument
                     Register'
                     records, (b) 'Derived' from data during computations, and (c) 'Custom' user defined uncertainty
                     sources
                     and values.</p>

                  <p>
                     <b>Name</b> = Custom uncertainty budget name. Uncertainty budgets are identified by a name that
                     must be
                     unique
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>Company</b> = The owner of the new uncertainty budget. The new budget(s) are accessible to any
                     user
                     within that company.

                  <p>
                     <b>Std Dev Used When Statistically Zero</b> = This value is used to overruled (overwrite) any
                     standard
                     deviation equal to zero. For example Medjil uses the sample standard deviation of observation sets
                     composed of measurements between the same pillars to calculate an uncertainty of the EDMI
                     measurements.
                     When all measurements in the one observation set are the same or if there is only one measurement
                     in the
                     observation set, the sample standard deviation is mathematically zero.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>Type</b> = Definition of uncertainty type. Type A means a statistically derived component or
                     uncertainty where Type B stands for any other derivation of uncertainty e.g. calibration report,
                     manufacturer's specification or an estimate based on experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>Distribution</b> = Definition of distribution associated with the uncertainty. A normal
                     distribution
                     is most associated with continuous univariate distributions such as many random variables.
                     A rectangular distribution represents an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bound (equal
                     probability anywhere within the range). For example rounding of a physical quantity or a resolution
                     of
                     digital instrument.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>Uncertainty</b> = The expanded uncertainty at 95% confidence in the units specified for the
                     uncertainty source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>K</b> = The coverage factor used to scale and expand the uncertainty from one standard deviation
                     (68%
                     confidence) to 95% confidence level. Typically 2.0 for a normal distribution or sqrt(3) for a
                     rectangular distribution. Medjil will auto complete this field as the distribution drop-down is
                     changed
                     but the user still has the ability to overwrite this field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>Dof</b> = Degrees of freedom. For a Type A uncertainty this is equal to the number of
                     measurements
                     minus the number of unknowns (redundant measurements). For a Type B uncertainty Dof needs to be
                     estimated. The following can be used as a guide: 3 for not very confident, 10 for moderate
                     confidence,
                     30 for very confident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <b>Group</b> = Uncertainty sources are categorised into 11 different groups. The group selected for
                     an
                     uncertainty source will affect the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The combining of error sources in the calibration report</li>

                  other EDM baseline/s (reference laboratory) to assess if it deliver the same results. The results can
                  be
                  assessed using the E<sub>n</sub> value ('Error normalised'):
               </p>
               <div>$$ E_n=\frac{(x_{lab}-x_{ref})}{(U_{lab}^2+U_{ref}^2)}\ \ \ (Eq. 7.4) $$ </div>
               <p>Where:</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>lab</sub> = corrected distance of the current baseline</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>ref</sub> = corrected distance of the reference baseline</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;U<sub>lab</sub> = uncertainty of the distance at the current baseline</p>
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;U<sub>ref</sub> = uncertainty of the distance at the reference baseline</p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  If the |E<sub>n</sub>| &#8804; 1 the results are satisfactory (new baseline (laboratory) is comparable
                  to
                  other baselines (laboratories) in terms of its performance) and if the |E<sub>n</sub>| > 1 the results
                  are unsatisfactory (baselines are not providing the same results).
