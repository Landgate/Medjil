                <p>
                    Digital levelling systems have long been used by the surveying and engineering industry to determine
                    height differences between any two or multiple locations for various applications. In Western
                    Australia, Landgate is responsible for the national standard of measure for length, in this case,
                    defined by the height difference or length measured in the vertical plane. In an effort to provide
                    an accurate and a uniform system of levelling across the State, Landgate established a staff
                    calibration range at Boya in 2002. The range comprises 2 observing pillars and 21 pins set in a
                    granite outcrop. The pins have been placed at optimum distances from the pillars and cater for
                    testing over a 4 metre height difference. The relative height differences between the pins have been
                    accurately determined by repeat observations using precision levels in conjunction with calibrated
                    invar staves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Boya Barcode Staff Calibration Range is monitored on a regular basis. Medjil is an online
                    platform developed by Landgate to ensure that the digital levelling systems, in particular, the
                    barcoded staves are calibrated from time to time maintain its required accuracy. Please go through

                <h2>2. About the Boya Staff Calibration Range</h2>

                <p> The Landgate barcode staff calibration range is located at the Land Surveyors Licensing Board's
                    examination site at Boya and consists of 2 observing pillars and a series of 21 stainless steel pins
                    set in a solid granite outcrop in a semi-arc rounding the two observing pillars.
                </p>

                <p> The two observing pillars were first constructed beside a large piece of sloping granite which had
                    the required 4 metres of height difference between top and bottom. The highest pillar is set at a
                    comfortable observing height and the lowest a metre lower and closer to the rock and range.
                </p>

                <p>The pins were glued into drilled holes in the granite while the observing pillars were concreted deep
                    into the ground to ensure their stability. With the 3 metre invar staff, it was possible to observe
                    from Pin 1 to 15 from the high pillar and from Pin 7 to Pin 21 from the lower pillar
                </p>

                    <li>Use the barcode staff booking sheet to record the collimation details and range observations
                        details in the field.</li>
                    <li>Check the bubble of the digital level and the staff. Re-adjust them if necessary. The staff
                        needs to be truly vertical for the best results.</li>
                    <li>Perform a collimation test on the digital level and use its software to compute and store the
                        constants calculated. For this purpose, four co-linear spikes in concrete 20 m apart have been
                        established adjacent to the range (see the <a

                    <li>Configure the settings in the digital level to record mean and standard deviation of measurement
                        from multiple readings (at least five), if possible. Otherwise, if the instrument does not allow
                        means from multiple observations, a minimum of three complete sets of observations (see 8 â€“ 10
                        below) is required for redundancy</li>
                    <li>Set the digital level on the high observing pillar (MV 83) and shade it from the sun. Pillar B
                        (low pillar) is utilised by Landgate when calibrating the range.</li>
                    <li>Position staff on the highest pin (Pin No 1) and allow at least 5 minutes to settle and adjust
                        to the ambient air temperature. Record the air temperature in the booking sheet with a shaded
