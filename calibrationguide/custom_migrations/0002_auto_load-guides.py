<p>Under the Licensed Surveyors (General Surveying Practice) Regulations 1961, regulation 20, the Surveyor General is to arrange for a standard or standards to be available to enable surveyors to comply with sub regulation 20(1). This sub regulation requires a surveyor to calibrate measuring equipment at regular intervals, not exceeding 2 years, and in accordance with acceptable practices.

The Surveyor General has tasked Survey Services with providing the standards and acceptable practices enabling a surveyor to be able to comply with regulation 20.

This procedure shall be applied whenever Landgate calibrates the Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton EDM baselines (standards).</p>

<h1>2. Procedure</h1>
<h2>2.1 Request a job to calibrate baselines</h2>
<p>Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton EDM baselines are calibrated every 2 years. The last date of calibration can be found on the current Regulation 13 certificate (see GS7/88/33). A geodetic job number is to be created for each of the baseline. </p>

<p>High precision EDMI (EDM and prism) must be used to calibrate the EDM baselines. The EDMI must be calibrated by an accredited NATA laboratory and requires a current Regulation 13 certificate. 
Baseline measurements must be performed in accordance with the ISO17123-4:2012 Optics and optical instruments – Field procedures for testing geodetic and surveying instruments – Part 4: Electro-optical distance meters (EDM measurements to reflectors).</p> 
<p>The following EDMI should be used to calibrate EDM baselines:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>TS30 s/n 364182 and GPH1P prism s/n 100</li>
</ul>

<p>A current calibration report is also required for all meteorological instruments used in the process of EDM baselines calibration. These instruments are to be calibrated externally by an accredited NATA laboratory. he following meteorological instruments should be used to calibrate EDM baselines:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Temperature and relative humidity meter s/n 21002807</li>
<li>Temperature and relative humidity meter s/n 21002811</li>
<li>Barometer s/n 74003848</li>
<li>Barometer s/n 11945508</li>
</ul>

<p>External calibrations are to be undertaken in accordance with CAL-02 document.</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason: Maintains legal traceability of equipment for baseline calibration.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.3 Measure baselines</h2>
<p>Prior to any EDM baseline calibration a notice (email) must be forwarded to the Land Surveyors Licensing Board for it to inform all relevant institutions and practicing licensed surveyors that the relevant EDM baseline will be closed between certain dates due to calibration activities.</p>

<p>All observation should commence only after the daily temperatures have stabilised. Temperature should not fluctuate more than 10ºC.</p>

<p>The instrument is initially set up on pillar 1 and the prism on pillar 2. An umbrella must shade the EDM instrument and meteorological instruments. The height of the EDM instrument and prism are measured and recorded at each pillar.</p>

<p>Meteorological observations of pressure, relative humidity and temperature are recorded for each distance measured. These measurements should be taken at the instrument and prism. Ensure meteorological equipment has stabilised before making observations.</p>

<p>Meteorological observations should not fall outside of the range for which the instrument has been calibrated. Below are the current ranges.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Temperature: +10 to +40ºC</li>
<li>Pressure: 750.00 to 1150mbars</li>
<li>Relative Humidity: 11 to 75 %RH</li>
</ul>

<p>Meteorological observations and the instrument and prism heights are entered into the EDM instrument. A minimum of four distances are measured at each setup and the prism is moved progressively through all pillars. The EDM instrument is then moved to pillar 2 and the prism is moved back through all pillars to pillar 1, measuring in the above manner. This process is repeated until the EDM instrument has occupied all pillars.</p>

<p>Short distances of 10 metres were not measured prior to 2021, however these distances are now observed.</p>

<p>The pillar alignment and height differences must be verified. All observations are recorded digitally and manually on booking sheets. Observations to be signed and stored by geodesist in an ECAL folder.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason: Observe data to compute the new baseline distances.</li>
<li>Output:  Completed observation booking sheets and digital file.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.4  EDM calibration for interlaboratory comparison</h2>
<p>After completing the EDM baseline calibration observations as per 2.3, an independent EDM Baseline measurements are to be undertaken for the purpose of interlaboratory comparison. The same instrument must be used for all interlaboratory comparisons undertaken at each baseline.</p>
<p>The following instrument and prism must be used for the interlaboratory comparison:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason: Observe data to compute the new baseline distances.</li>
</ul>
<h1>S16 s/n 3012827 and GPH1P prism s/n 100</h1>
<p>This EDM calibration is to be undertaken in accordance with CAL-03.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:  Capture data for evaluation of calibrations. Ref ISO 17025:2017 7.2.2.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.5 Import observations into the EDM Baseline calibration portal</h2>
<p>Prior to importing, the EDM baseline observations must be corrected by the values provided in the Table 2 (results of measurement) of the NMI calibration report. Only the corrected observations are then imported into the "Baseline calibration" portal for processing to determine the new certified distances and uncertainties of the EDM Baseline.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:  Computation of Certified EDM Baseline distances.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.6 Data entry QA</h2>
<p>All data must is verified by the Senior Geodesist (or another Senior Property Location Officer) by comparing a hardcopy print of the input data with the original baseline booking sheets.</p>

<p>Any errors found must be corrected before the computation.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:  Data QA control.</li>
<li>Position: Senior Geodesist</li>
</ul>

<p>Inspect the calibration report and certificate and compare the new certified distances against the previous certified distances. Large residuals may indicate pillar movement or an error in the calibration process. If differences between new and previous certified distances are found included in the final report potential reason for the difference (e.g. pillar movement).</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:   Ensures no gross errors and/or pillar movement.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.8 Estimate uncertainty of distances</h2>
<p>The estimation of uncertainty is to be considered in conjunction with ISO 17123:4.</p>
<p>The estimated EDM baseline distances are influenced by the following sources of uncertainty:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Uncertainty of the EDM measurement</li>
<li>Atmospheric measurements</li>
<li>Error patterns from mechanical setup</li>
<li>Eounding error quantities</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table lists the error budget used for the calculation of uncertainty of EDM Baseline's distances:</p>

<h1>3. Instrument Calibration Procedure</h1>
<h2>3.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>There are a number of sources of error inherent in surveying equipment. The three distinct systematic errors, which may occur in EDM instruments are:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Zero constant or index error</li>
<li>Scale error</li>
<li>Cyclic or short periodic error</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure, know as EDMI calibration, is designed to identify the above errors and to determine instrument constants and errors (instrument correction). Tis is achieved by conducting a series of measurements on a certified baseline.</p> 

<p>Note: It is beyond the scope of this procedure to identify all sources of error inherent in surveying equipment. Surveyors should be aware of the limitations of the equipment they use and ensure that it is well maintained and regularly checked.</p>

<h2>3.2 Legislative Requirements</h2>
<p>Matters relating to the uncertainty of surveys are detailed in Regulation 5 of the <i>Licensed Surveyors (General Surveying Practice) Regulation 1961</i>.</p>

<p>Matters relating to EDMI calibration are detailed in Regulation 20 of the <i>Licensed Surveyors (General Surveying Practice) Regulation 1961</i>.</p>

<h2>3.3 Verification of EDMI Errors</h2>
<h3>3.3.1  Zero Constant or Index Error</h3>

<p>Distances measured by a EDMI (combination of instrument and reflector) are subject to a constant error caused by the following three factors:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Electrical delays, geometrical detours and eccentricities in the instruments</li>
<li>Differences between the electronic centre and the mechanical centre of the instrument</li>
<li>Differences between the optical and mechanical centres of the reflector</li>
</ul>

<p>Once determined the value needs to be applied directly to every measurement. Note: Constant error applies only to a tested combination of instrument and reflector and it needs to be checked after changes of reflector, or after jolts, or instrument mounting or after service.</p>

<h3>3.3.2 Scale error</h3>
<p>Scale error is proportional to the length of the distance measured and is caused by:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Internal frequency errors, including those caused by external temperature and instrument "warm up" effects</li>
<li>Uncertainty of measured temperature, pressure and humidity which affect the velocity of the propagation</li>
<li>Non-homogeneous emissions/reception patterns from the emitting and receiving diodes (phase inhomogeneities)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3.3 Cyclic error</h3>
<p>The precision of an EDM instrument dependents on the precision of the internal phase measurement. Unwanted interference either through electronic/optical cross talk or multi-path effects of the transmitted signal onto the received signal causes cyclic error.  The major form of the cyclic error is sinusoidal with a wavelength equal to the unit length of the instrument. The unit length is the scale on which the EDM instrument measures the distance and is derived from the fine measuring frequency.  Unit length is equal to one half of the modulation wavelength (Rueger 1984).  The magnitude of the cyclic error can be of the order of 5 - 10 mm, but it will vary depending on the actual length measured.</p>

<h2>3.4 EDM Baselines provided in Western Australia</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 Curtin University Baseline</h3>

<p>In 1995 the Surveyor General reconditioned a ten-pillar baseline at Curtin University which had been in use for approximately ten years.  Renovation included the placement of two additional pillars making the baseline a twelve-pillar baseline.  New stainless steel pillar plate tops were provided to all pillars, with a 5/8" Whitworth threaded bolt at the centre of each pillar top. This baseline is situated on Curtin University property parallel to Kent Street, Bentley. The baseline is partially accessible by vehicles at all times via the track alongside the baseline.  Permission is not necessary to use the baseline.  Any conflict of usage should be decided on a first to occupy basis. The Curtin University contact is Ahmed El-Mowafy, Director of Graduate Research phone 9266 3403, mobile 0403165643 or Email a.el-mowafy@curtin.edu.au. When contacting Curtin by Email please cc Petra Helmholz into the conversation.</p>

<h3>3.4.2 Kalgoorlie Baseline</h3>

<p>This EDM calibration baseline is situated on the Department of Mines and Petroleum Resources Explosives Reserve in Piccadilly Street, Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie baseline consists of eight pillars set out such that all pillars are colinear. The baseline is readily accessible to 2WD vehicles when dry and is situated in a non-volatile area of the reserve. Phone in advance to ensure access 9091 7590.  Any conflict of usage should be decided on a first to occupy basis.</p>

<h3>3.4.3 Busselton Baseline</h3>
<p>This EDM calibration baseline is situated on the Busselton Bypass west of Redgum Way and east of the Bussell Highway. The baseline consists of six pillars set out such that all pillars are colinear. The baseline is readily accessible to all vehicles. The baseline is accessible by vehicles at all times via the track alongside the length of the baseline.  Permission is not necessary to use the baseline.  Any conflict of usage should be decided on a first to occupy basis.</p>

<h2>3.5 Minimum Standard for the Uncertainty of Calibration</h2>
<p>Recommendation No 8 of the Working Party of the National Standards Commission on the calibration of Electromagnetic Distance Measuring (EDM) equipment in 1983 states that the minimum standard for the uncertainty of calibrations of an EDM instrument should be:</p>
<p>± (4.0mm + 20ppm)     (5.1)</p>
<p>at the 95% confidence level.  This recommendation means that an instrument correction is derived for a distance meter/reflector combination from measurements on a certified EDM baseline and that the uncertainty (against the National Standard) of this instrument correction (IC) shall not exceed ± (4.0mm + 20ppm).  Subsequent to a calibration, the derived instrument correction is applied to distance measurements, thus bringing the distance meter readings in line with the National Standard of length.  In terms of standard deviation, the instrument correction must be accurate to at least</p>
<p>± (2.0mm + 12ppm)     (5.2)</p>
<p>It is important to realise that the uncertainty and standard deviations listed above refer to the accuracy of the instrument correction and not to the precision of a distance measurement.  The expression at (5.2) does not relate in any way with the accuracy specification quoted by manufacturers for their instruments.</p>

<h2>3.6 Verification Method</h2>
<p>The verification method involves the measurement of a set of distances between pillars on the EDM baseline to determine the existence and magnitude of any errors present.</p>

<h2>3.7 Verification Procedures</h2>
<p>Booking sheets for the Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton baselines are available.</p>

<h3>3.7.1 Measurement procedure on baselines</h3>
<p>Ascertain the unit length of the instrument (half of the modulation wavelength of the fine measurement) and record on the booking sheet. This length should be provided under the technical specifications for the instrument in the manufacturer's handbook.</p>

<h3>3.7.2 Sequence of measurements for a complete verification</h3>
<h4>3.7.2.1 Curtin University Baseline</h4>

<p>Place EDM on pillar 2 and measure to pillars 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11B and 12 in turn. Then shift EDM to pillar 3 and measure to pillars 12, 11B, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 in turn. This sequence requires the reflector to be moved up and down the line only once. Then follow 3.7.2.4.</p>

<h4>3.7.2.2 Kalgoorlie Baseline</h4>
<p>Place EDM on pillar 1 and measure to pillars 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in turn. Then shift EDM to pillar 2 and measure to pillars 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 in turn. This sequence requires the reflector to be moved up and down the line only once. Then follow 3.7.2.4.</p>

<h4>3.7.2.3 Busselton Baseline</h4>
<p>Place EDM on pillar 1 and measure to pillars 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in turn. Then shift EDM to pillar 2 and measure to pillars 6, 5, 4, 3 and 1 in turn. This sequence requires the reflector to be moved up and down the line only once. Then follow 3.7.2.4.</p>

<h4>3.7.2.4 Procedure for all Baselines</h4>
<ol STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Complete EDM instrument 'check and adjust' as per manufacturer instruction.</li>
<li>EDM instruments, thermometer and barometer are to be shaded by an umbrella in sunny and rainy conditions. Only one thermometer and barometer is required. A psychrometer or digital weather station may be used to measure relative humidity for a more accurate determination of atmospheric correction (not relevant to all EDM's). Ensure meteorological equipment has stabilised before making observations.</li>
<li>Level EDM instrument and reflector carefully on all stations.  Start with all foot screws in the mid position. The stainless steel pillar tops have been set level on pillars.</li>
<li>Measure all heights to the instrument and prism from the pillar plate accurately to 1mm.</li>
<li>The instrument should remain switched on during the whole calibration process.</li>
<li>The same reflector, reflector mounting and tribrach should be used for all measurements.  The reflector must have a unique identification (serial number) which must be entered on the booking sheet.</li>
<li>All calibration measurements can be taken in either daytime or night-time but a mixture of day and night measurements is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Meteorological field equipment will have current calibration status.</li>
<li>On each line, four separate distance measurements should be taken as a minimum, with re-pointing after each measurement. </li>
<li>Atmospheric Correction Control - Atmospheric corrections using corrected observed temperature and pressure should be entered into the EDM instrument.  This is essential for Pulsed EDM instruments.  Temperatures and pressure should be noted for every distance measured.  Observers must note on the booking sheet whether the atmospheric correction control (PPM) is set to zero, or has been set according to the prevailing temperature and pressure.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2.8 Reduction and Interpretation</h2>
<p>This portal has been developed by Landgate for the calibration of EDM instruments against baselines.</p>
<p>The calibration results and measurements for each EDM instrument and baseline are stored in a database for future reference and legal traceability.  The Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton baseline details have already been included in the database, but additional baselines may be added.  A selection of EDM instruments and reflector makes and models are also included.</p>
<p>The instrument details and measured distances are entered interactively by the operator.  After the observed data is reduced to obtain horizontal distances and their associated variances, a least squares adjustment is performed. The adjustment is performed according to ISO standard.</p>
<p>The portal produces report for analysing instrument calibration details. A final report which summarises the results of an EDI calibration is produced.</p> 
<p>The minimum standards for the uncertainty of calibration are described in terms of Recommendation No.8 of the working party of the National Standards Commission on the calibration of EDM Equipment of 1 February 1983.  All uncertainties are specified at the 95% confidence level. </p>""",

<p>The Landgate provides barcode staff calibration range (the Range) located at the Land Surveyors Licensing Board's examination site at Boya. The site consists of 2 observing pillars and a series of 21 stainless steel pins set in a solid granite outcrop.</p>

<p>The pins have been placed at optimum distances from the observing pillars and allows for calibrating staff up to 4 metre height. 

<p>The relative height differences between the pins have been accurately determined by repeat observations using precision levels and calibrated invar staves. Landgate regularly re-observes the Range to ensure its accuracy. This portal provides ensure staves are calibrated based on a time-dependent (most up to date) calibration range.</p>

<h1>2. Stave calibration procedure</h1>
<h2>2.1 Use the barcode staff booking sheet to record the collimation details and range observations details in the field.</h2>
<h2>2.2 Check the bubble of the digital level and the staff. Re-adjust them if necessary. The staff needs to be truly vertical for the best results.</h2>
<h2>2.3 Perform a collimation test on the digital level and use its software to compute and store the constants calculated. For this purpose, four co-linear spikes in concrete 20 m apart have been established adjacent to the range (see the Access Sketch).</h2>
<h2>2.4 Configure the settings in the digital level to record mean and standard deviation of observations from multiple readings (at least five), if possible. Otherwise, if the instrument does not allow means from multiple observations, a minimum of three complete sets of observations (see 8 – 10 below) is required to achieve sufficient redundancy.</h2>
<h2>2.5 After completing the collimation test set the digital level on the highest observing pillar (MV 83) and shade it from the sun. Pillar B (low pillar) is only utilised by Landgate when calibrating the range.</h2>
<h2>2.6 Position staff on the highest pin (Pin No 1) and allow at least 5 minutes to settle and adjust to the ambient air temperature. Record the air temperature in the booking sheet with the shaded thermometer.</h2>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Medjil portal has been develop by Department of Land Information of Western Australia (LANDGATE) with collaboration with other jurisdictions for:</p>
        <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
            <li>Calibration of a Baseline against a standardised instrument</li>
            <li>Calibration of EDM Instruments (EDMI) against standard baseline</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The aim of the EDM Instrument calibration is to establish the traceability of users’ instruments to National Standards by determination of the instrument correction and its expanded uncertainty (~95% confidence limits). This is achieved by the certification of reference instruments of the States and Territories by the National Measurement Institute (NMI), by the certification of baselines by the verifying authorities of the States and Territories and by calibrating the users’ instruments against said baselines.</p> 
        <p>The calibration of Baseline determines new/refined distances between its pillars. This should be conducted on regular basis and using high precision calibrated instrument. The calibration of an EDMI provides instrument specific distance correction to be applied to measurements taken by this instrument.</p>
        <p>The Medjil portal provided tools and reports for both Baseline and EDMI calibration procedures. Refer to specific guides for field calibration instructions.</p>
        <p>This document provides reference information such as mathematical equations, procedures, algorithms, and computations adopted by the portal. The procedures and equations are based on the following resources:</p>

The determination of the a priori standard deviations and the analysis of uncertainties of EDM measurements are based on the general guidelines within this handbook.</p> 
    <p>The minimum standards for the uncertainty of an EDM instrument calibration are described in terms of Recommendation No,8 of the Working Party of the National Standards Commission on the calibration of EDM Equipment of 1 February, 1983. All uncertainties are specified at the 95% confidence level. Users can adopt or change default uncertainties and associated traceability statements.</p>

        <h1>1    Baseline Calibration</h1>
        <h2>1.1    Baseline Designs</h2>
        <p>Since the introduction of EDM instruments the EDM basline has been their preffered calibration method. There are three main baseline designs:</p>
        <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
            <li>Heerbrugg Design</li>
            <li>Aarau Design</li>
            <li>Hobart Design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All baseline designs aim at an equal distribution of all measured distances between the shortest and longest line on the baseline, with no repetitions and easy computation with or without known distances. Some baseline designs incorporate a multiple of a basic unit length of EDM instrument(s). A detailed explanation of a different baseline design concepts is out of scope of this manual. For baseline design details refer to the Electronic Distance Measurement book by J.M.Rueger.</p>
        
        <h2>1.2    Mathematical model and observation equations for the calibration of Baseline</h2>    
        <p>To avoid negative distances and to provide greater flexibility of Baseline survey, the following two observation equations can be derived:</p>
        <div> $$ D_{ij}=x_j-x_i-zpc\ \ \ for\ j > i\ \ \ (Eq. 1.1)$$ </div>    
        <div>    $$ D_{ij}=x_i-x_j-zpc\ \ \ for\ j < i\ \ \ (Eq. 1.2)$$ </div>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;D<sub>ij</sub> = Measured distance between pillars i and j (the observations)</p>    
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>i</sub> = Distance from the first pillar to pillar 'i'. Distance corrected for the pillar ofsets and reduced to baseline reference height.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>j</sub> = Distance from the first pillar to pillar 'j'. Distance corrected for the pillar ofsets and reduced to baseline reference height.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;zpc = zero point correction - an additive constant of the certified EDMI</p>        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;All distances measured with a certified EDM instrumentation (EDMI)</p>        
        <h2>1.3    Example: Formation of observation equations</h2>
        <p>Consider the following example Baseline consisting of 4 pillars:</p>                
        <img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_1_1.png" alt="Example basline">    
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>As per the Eq. 1.1 and Eq. 1.2 the  following set of linear observation equations can formed:</p>    
        <div>    $$ \begin{matrix}D_{12}=&{+X}_2&&&-zpc\\D_{13}=&&{+X}_3&&-zpc\\D_{14}=&&&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{21}=&{+X}_2&&&-zpc\\D_{23}=&-X_2&+X_3&&-zpc\\D_{24}=&-X_2&&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{31}=&&+X_3&&-zpc\\D_{32}=&-X_2&{+X}_3&&-zpc\\D_{34}=&&-X_3&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{41}=&&&+X_4&-zpc\\D_{42}=&-X_2&&+X_4&-zpc\\D_{43}=&&-X_3&+X_4&-zpc\\\end{matrix}\ \ \ (Eq. 1.3)$$ </div>    
        <p>The observation equations can be further expressed in a matrix notation as D = AX</p>        
        <div>    $$ \left[\begin{matrix}D_{12}\\D_{13}\\D_{14}\\D_{21}\\D_{23}\\D_{24}\\D_{31}\\D_{32}\\D_{34}\\D_{41}\\D_{42}\\D_{43}\\\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}1&0&0&-1\\0&1&0&-1\\0&0&1&-1\\1&0&0&-1\\-1&1&0&-1\\-1&0&1&-1\\0&1&0&-1\\-1&1&0&-1\\0&-1&1&-1\\0&0&1&-1\\-1&0&1&-1\\0&-1&1&-1\\\end{matrix}\right]\left[\begin{matrix}X_2\\X_3\\X_4\\zpc\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 1.4)$$ </div>    
        <p>Where:</p>    
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;D<sub>ij</sub> = Measured distance between pillars i and j (vector of the observations)</p>        
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A = The design matrix
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;X = The certified distances and zpc (vector of the unknown output estimates)</p>    
        <p>This approach does not require to provide approximate distances between pillars. The observations together with a-priori uncertainties (P) are least squares adjusted as per Section (6) to provides the estimated certified distances d<sub>x</sub> and the zpc with the full VCV matrix.</p>        
        <h2>1.4    Inter-pillar distances survey</h2>

        <h2>1.5    Pillar offsets survey</h2>
        <p>Considering the following drawing:</p>
        <img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_1_2.png" alt="Pillar Offsets">    
        <p>the offsets (O) for each pillar (j) to the line between first (1) and last (n) pillars can be derived from survey observations as follows:</p> 
        <div>    $$O_j=d_{ij}sin\left(A_{1n}-A_{ij}\right)\ \ \ (Eq. 1.5)$$ </div>        
        <h2>1.6    Pillar heights survey</h2>
        <p>Pilar heights (H<sub>j</sub>) are to be determined as orthometric heights (eg. AHD) using spirit levelling survey and are provided with standard deviations derived from multiple observations.</p>

        <h1>2    EDMI Calibration</h1>
        <h2>2.1    Systematic errors in EDM instruments</h2>
        <p>There are three distinct systematic errors which may occur in EDM instruments. The calibration of an instrument on a certified baseline allows to determine the specific instrument - prism correction that can elimination of the following errors:</p>
        <h3>2.1.1 Zero Point Correction (zpc)</h3>    
        <p>All distances measured by a particular EDM instrument and reflector combination are subject to a constant error caused by three factors:</p>
        <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
            <li>Electrical delays, geometrical detours and eccentricities in the instruments</li> 
            <li>Differences between the electronic centre and the mechanical centre of the instrument</li>
            <li>Differences between the optical and mechanical centres of the reflector (prism)</li>
            <li>This error may vary with changes of reflector, or after jolts, or with different instrument mountings. It is an algebraic constant to be applied directly to every measurement</li>        
        </ul>        
        <h3>2.1.2 Scale Correction Factor (scf)</h3>    
        <p>Scale Correction Factor is proportional to the length of the distance measured and is caused by:</p>
        <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
            <li>Internal frequency errors, including those caused by external temperature and instrument “warm up” effects</li> 
            <li>Errors of measured temperature, pressure and humidity affect the velocity (and path?) of the electromagnetic wave</li>
            <li>Non-homogeneous emissions/reception patterns from the emitting and receiving diodes (phase inhomogeneities)</li>
        </ul>        
        <h3>2.1.3 Cyclic Errors</h3>    
        <p>The precision of an EDM instrument dependents on the precision of the internal phase measurements. Unwanted interference through electronic/optical cross talk or multi-path effects of the transmitted signal on to the received signal causes cyclic errors. The major form of the cyclic error is sinusoidal with a wavelength equal to the unit length of the instrument. The unit length is the scale on which the EDM instrument measures the distance and is derived from the fine measuring frequency. Unit length is equal to one half of the modulation wavelength.</p>
        <h2>2.2    Mathematical model of the EDM Instrument Correction (IC)</h2>
            <div>    $$ IC=zpc+scf*D+b_1\sin{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+b_2\cos{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+b_3\sin{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+b_4\cos{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)}}}}\ \ \ (Eq. 2.1)$$ </div>                
          <p>Where:</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;IC = Instrument Correction</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;D = Distance</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;zpc = Zero Point Correction</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;scf = Scale Correction Factor (x:1)</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;U = Instrument Unit Length (m) - wavelength</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;b<sub>i</sub> = Cyclic error parameters</p>    
        <p>By default Medjil solution provides zpc and scf for the EDMI. Medjil is also capable of solving for a cyclic error parameter which is based on wavelength cycle errors. Solving for cyclic error however, is optional as the ability to detect this error reliably depends on the baseline design.</p>        
        <h2>2.3 Observation equations</h2>    
        <p>For n distances measured by an EDMI on a certified baseline the following observation equation can be derived:</p>
        <div>    $$ d_i=zpc+scf*D+b_1\sin{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+b_2\cos{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+b_3\sin{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+b_4\cos{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)}}}}\ \ \ (Eq. 2.2)$$ </div>        
        <p>to be finished</p>            
    </div>
    <div><!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
        <h1>3    Corrections</h1>
        <h3>3.1 Calibration Correction</h3>
        <p>Medjil maintains an instrument register that catalogues all instruments used for calibrations. Instrument register belongs to an individual company. The registry includes the archive of calibration certificates for EDMI, Barometer, Thermometer and Hygrometer. If calibration corrections have not been applied to instrument readings, Medjil allows calibration corrections to be applied to the raw readings during the Medjil calibration.</p>
        <h4>3.1.1 Meteorological instrumentation corrections</h4>
        <p>All meteorological instruments (thermometer, barometer, hygrometer) corrections appy as zero point correction (zpc) to the EDMI readings (distance)</p>
        <div>c<sub>M</sub> = zpc</div>
        <h4>3.1.2 EDMI correction</h4>
        <p>EDMI calibration sourced from the most recent calibration certificate:</p>        
        <div>c<sub>EDMI</sub> = sfc * d + zpc</div>    
        <br>    
        <p>If the meteorological corrections have not been applied to EDMI readings, corrections to atmospheric readings will be applied prior to calculating the first velocity correction.</p>
        <h3>3.2 First velocity correction (K)</h3>
        <div>$$ \mathrm{K\ }=\left[\mathrm{C-}\frac{\mathrm{DP}}{(\mathrm{273.15}+t)}+\frac{\mathrm{11.27e} }{(\mathrm{273.15}+t)}\right]1\mathrm{0}^{\mathrm{-6}}d\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.1)$$</div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;K = First velocity correction in metres</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;P = Pressure in millibars/hectopascals</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;t = Dry temperature in degrees Celsius</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;d = Distance in metres</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;e = Partial water pressure in hectopascals</p>

        <p>$$D = (n_G – 1) 10^6 (273.15 / 1013.25)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.2)$$</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;n<sub>G</sub> = Group refractive index of atmosphere for standard conditions</p>
        <p>Partial vapour pressure is derived from relative humidity:</>
        <div>$$ \mathrm{e\ }=\ \frac{\mathrm{E\ h}}{\mathrm{100}}\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.3) $$</div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;e = Partial water vapour pressure in hectopascals</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;h = Relative humidity in percent</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;E = Saturation water vapour pressure (hPa) at the dry bulb temperature:</p>
        <div>$$ \mathrm{E\ }=\ \left[\mathrm{1.0007\ }+\ \left(\mathrm{3.46\ p}\right)10^{-6}\right]\ \times\mathrm{6.1121\ exp}\left[\frac{\mathrm{17.502\ t}}{\left(\mathrm{240.94\ }+\mathrm{\ t}\right)}\right]\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.4) $$</div>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;t = Dry temperature in degrees Celsius</p>        
        <h3>3.2.2 Reference Refractive Index (n<sub>REF</sub>)</h3>
        <p>The reference refractive index is instrument specific:</p>
        <div>$$ n_{\mathrm{REF}}=\frac{C_O}{\lambda_{\mathrm{MOD\ }}f_{MOD}}=\frac{C_O}{2Uf_{MOD}}\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.5) $$</div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;C<sub>O</sub> = Velocity of light in a vacuum = 299 792 458 m/s</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&#955<sub>MOD</sub> = Constant modulation wavelength of the fine measurements for which the instrument is designed</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;f<sub>MOD</sub> = Constant modulation frequency of the fine measurements</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;U = The exact half of &#955<sub>MOD</sub> , called the unit length of the instrument.</p>
        <p>The velocity of light in a vacuum is fixed at 299792458 m/s by the 1983 definition of the SI metre.</p>
        <p>The unit length of the instrument (U) and the constant modulation frequency of the fine measurements (f<sub>MOD</sub>) are instrument specific and are generally provided by the manufacturer.</p>
        <h3>3.2.3  Group refractive Index of light in the atmosphere</h3>
        <p>In electro-optical EDM, the refractive index is dependent on the wavelength of the visible or infrared radiation. Different frequencies have the same propagation velocity in a vacuum, but not in air because of the interference occurrence between the different frequencies. The signal resulting from the sum of all frequencies will have the so-called group velocity, which is always smaller than the phase velocities of its individual frequencies.</p>
        <p>The International Association of Geodesy (IAG) resolved in 1999 at its XXIIth General Assembly in Birmingham that the refractive index in electronic distance measurements (nL) can be calculated using the computer procedure published by Ciddor & Hill in Applied Optics(1999, Vol.38, N0.9, 1663-1667) and Ciddor in Applied Optics (1996, Vol.35, No.9, 1566-1573).</p>
        <p>The following closed formulae can be adopted for the computation of the group refractive index in air for electronic distance measurements to within 1 ppm with visible and near infrared waves in the atmosphere:</p>
        <div>$$ N_L=\left(n_L-1\right)\mathrm{\mathrm{.1}}0^6=\left(\frac{\mathrm{273.15\ }}{1013.25}.\frac{N_Gp}{(273.15+t)}\right)\mathrm{\mathrm{-}}\left(\frac{1\mathrm{1.27e}}{\left(\mathrm{273.15}+t\right)}\right)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.6)$$ </div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;N<sub>L</sub> = Group refractivity of visible and near infrared waves in ambient moist air. Valid for atmospheric conditions described by t, p and e</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;n<sub>L</sub> = Corresponding group refractive index</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;N<sub>G</sub> = Group refractivity index for standard conditions (visible light in dry air at 0 C, 1013.25 hPa, partial water vapour pressure = 0 and the air contains 0.0375 % CO<sub>2</sub>). See Equation 3.7.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;t = Dry bulb temperature of air (C).</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;p = Atmospheric pressure in hectopascals</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;e = Partial water vapour pressure (hPa)</p>
        <div>$$ N_G=\left(n_G-1\right)\mathrm{\mathrm{1}}\mathrm{0}^6\ =\mathrm{\mathrm{\ \ 2}87.6155\ }+\left(\frac{4.88660}{\lambda^2}\right)+\ \left(\frac{\mathrm{0.06800}}{\lambda^4}\right)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.7)$$</div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&#955 = carrier wavelength in micrometres (&#956;m) in a vacuum
        <p>These closed formulae (Eq. 3.6 and 3.7) deviate less than 0.25 ppm from the accurate formulae between -30 C and +45 C, at 1000 hPa pressure, 100% relative humidity (without condensation) and for wavelengths between 650 nm and 850 nm. 
            The 1.0 ppm stated before makes some allowance for anomalous refractivity and the uncertainty in the determination of the atmospheric parameters. The equations were recommended by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) at its XXIIth General Assembly in Birmingham, 1999 and have been used in the software.</p>

        <p>The geometric correction equations 3.8 and 3.9 were derived from The Australian Geodetic Datum Technical Manual, National Mapping Council of Australia, Special Publication 10 and are suitable for baselines with steep gradients.</p> 
        <p>Medjil uses the GRS80 spheroid for determining the mean radius of the earth (R) used in the calculation of the geometric correction.

    <h1>4 Uncertainties</h1>
        <p>Medjil uses the following terminology:</p>
        <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
            <li>‘Uncertainty’ to refers to the GUM’s ‘expanded uncertainty' (95% confidence level or two sigmas)</li> 
            <li>‘Standard deviation’ refers to the GUM’s ‘standard uncertainty’ (68% confidence level or one sigma)</li>
            <li>‘Coverage factor’ numerical factor used as a multiplier of the standard uncertainty in order to obtain an expanded uncertainty</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Medjil complies with the ISO 17123 (all parts) recommendations to evaluate individual precision (experimental standard deviation known as Type A standard uncertainty) of individual instrument but also to define uncertainty budget which allows for combining all uncertainty components (random or systematic - Type B) to derive combined standard uncertainty (or expanded uncertainty) as a representative measure of accuracy.</p>    
        <h2>4.1    Combined standard and expanded uncertainty</h2>
        <p>The combined standard uncertainty C<sub>SU</sub> of a number of individual uncertainty sources (u<sub>i</sub>) is computed using the following formula:</p>
        <div>$$ C_{SU}=√(∑_{(i=1)}^n u_{i}^2)\ \ \ (Eq. 4.1)  $$</div>
        <p>The combined expanded uncertainty C<sub>EU</sub> is defined as follows:</p>
        <div>$$ C_{EU}=C_{SU}k\ \ \ (Eq. 4.2)  $$</div>        
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;k = coverage factor</p>
        <div>$$ k=t_{(95\%, v_{eff})}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.3) $$</div>    
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;v<sub>eff</sub> = effective degrees of freedom</p>
        <div>$$ v_{eff}=\frac{s^4}{C_{su}}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.4)  $$</div>        
        <div>$$ s=∑_{(i=1)}^n\frac{u_{i}^4}{v_i}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.5)  $$</div>    
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;v<sub>i</sub> = degrees of freedom of uncertainty source (i)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;t = t-student distribution (probability, effective degrees of freedom)</p>    
        <h2>4.2    Uncertainty budget</h2>
        <p>An uncertainty budget consists of a table of the uncertainty sources that contribute to the combined uncertainty. Medjil automatically populates some records in the uncertainty budget and allows users to add custom uncertainty sources to the uncertainty budget.</p> 
        <h3>4.2.1    Automatically populated uncertainty sources</h3>
        Medjil automatically the populates the uncertainty sources (Table 4.1 and Table 4.2) when processing the calibration of EDM baselines and EDM Instrumentation.</p>

    <p>The values for these automatically populated uncertainty sources are derived as follows:</p>
    <ul STYLE="margin:30px">
            <li>Certified distances - Least Squares Adjustment (LSA) uncertainty - The uncertainty of each inter-pillar distance is uniquely assigned from the diagonal elements of the Cofactormatrix derived from the least squares adjustment of the baseline calibration. The degrees of freedom is the equal to the degrees of freedom of the calibration of the baseline and the coverage factor is derived from  t-student distribution at 95% and selected degrees of freedom t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub></li>
            <li>EDM LS zero offset - Zero Point Correction (ZPC) uncertainty - The uncertainty of the zero point correction is assigned from last element of the Cofactormatrix derived from the least squares adjustment of the baseline calibration.  The degrees of freedom is the equal to the degrees of freedom of the calibration of the baseline and the coverage factor is the t-student at 95% and selected degrees of freedom (t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub>)</li>

The selected values correspond to the most current certificate (at the time of survey) of the EDMI used for the calibration of the EDM Baseline</li>
            <li>EDM scale factor - EDM scale factor (drift over time) - The uncertainty is derived using linear regression of the scale factors from all available calibration certificates of the same EDM Baseline (certified distances). The scale factor is extrapolated at the time of calibration survey and the difference between this value and the last computed value (as per the most current certificate) is adopted as the uncertainty. This uncertainty source is assigned 30 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3</li>
            <li>EDMI measurement - Distance Instrument Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half of the instrument measurement increment reading. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li>
            <li>EDMI measurement - Linear regression on EDM distance standard deviations - Table 4.3 shows an example of a typical subset of EDMI measurements observed on a EDM Baseline. Measurements with the same ‘From’ and ‘To’ pillar are grouped into sets, then average and standard deviations of these sets are tabulated. The ‘Std Dev Used when statistically zero’ field value defined in the specified Uncertainty Budget of the calibration can be used to exclude and overwrite experimental standard deviations of measurement sets that have all the same values (eg. experimental standard deviations equal to zero).
                <br>Linear regression is used on the average ‘slope distance’ and ‘standard deviation’ to derive a formula for the experimental standard deviation of EDMI measurements in the calibration:
                s<sub>B</sub> = P mm + Q ppm. Where s<sub>B</sub> is the standard deviation of a baseline interval. 
                <br>Uncertainties are uniquely assigned to each measurement set as calculated from the derived linear regression equation. This uncertainty source is assigned 30 degrees of freedom and the coverage factor is the t-student at 95% and 30 degrees of freedom t<sub>(95%,30)</sub></li>
            <li>Heights - Height Differences - During the ‘Calibrate an EDM Baseline’ process, a *.csv file is required to upload the standard uncertainty (standard deviation) of the heights of each pillar.

            <li>Humidity - Hygrometer calibrated correction factor - Hygrometers used for baseline calibration surveys must have a calibration that indicates the uncertainty of the readings. Medjil will automatically assign a current hygrometer calibration based on the survey date. The uncertainty, coverage factor and degrees of freedom specified for that hygrometer calibration record will be used for the uncertainty ‘Humidity - Hygrometer calibrated correction factor’</li>  
            <li>Humidity - Hygrometer Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half the measurement increment reading of the instrument used for the calibration. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li> 
            <li>Offsets - Offsets - Table 4.4 shows the results of a typical alignment survey. The offset of each pillar is surveyed from multiple pillars. The offset results with the same ‘To Pillar’ are grouped into sets, then the average and experimental standard deviations of these sets are tabulated. The uncertainty of each offset is derived from the standard deviation of the offset measurements at both the ‘From Pillar’ and the ‘To Pillar’.
            <div>    $$ {\rm uc}_o=k\sqrt{\left(o_i^2+o_j^2\right)}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.7)   $$ </div>

The uncertainty, coverage factor and degrees of freedom specified for that hygrometer calibration will be used for the uncertainty ‘Temperature - Thermometer calibrated correction factor’</li> 
            <li>Temperature - Thermometer Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half the measurement increment reading of the instrument used for the calibration. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li>             
            <li>Certified distances - Uncertainty of Certified Distances - The standard uncertainty of all inter-pillar distances are calculated from the CoFactorMatrix of baseline calibrations. This is done by creating a design matrix for every combination of pillars and calculating another CoFactorMatrix according to the formula:</li>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;A<sub>2</sub> = A design matrix for every possible combination of from and to pillars</p>
          <p>The standard uncertainties of all inter-pillar distances are equivalent to the square root of the diagonals of the secondary CoFactorMatrix. These values are stored for each baseline calibration. The inter-pillar distance standard uncertainties that correspond to EDMI calibrations are used to calculate the ‘Uncertainty of Certified Distances’ according to the formula:</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>ij</sub> = k * S<sub>ij</sub></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>ij</sub> = Expanded uncertainty of a distance between pillar i and pillar j</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;k = Coverage factor of a baseline calibration determined by the t-student at 95% and LSA derived degree of freedom (dof) t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub></p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>ij</sub> = Standard uncertainty of a distance between pillar i and pillar j</p>
            <li>EDM Calibration - Uncertainty of LSA EDMI Correction - This is a type A uncertainty output by the least squares adjustment used to determine calibration parameters for the calibration of EDM Instrumentation. The uncertainty of the parameters are equivalent to the diagonal elements of the Cofactormatrix. The ‘Uncertainty of (LSA) EDMI Correction’ is calculated according to the following conditions:</li>            
            <p>(a) if the calibration of the EDMI has tested for cyclic errors and found them to be significant:</p>
            <div>    $$ S_{IC}=S_{zpc}+S_{scf}D+S_1\sin{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+S_2\cos{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+S_3\sin{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+S_4\cos{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)}}}}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.9)$$ </div>

    <h3>4.2.2    Custom uncertainty budgets</h3>
    <p>Medjil default uncertainty budget is used during the calibration process and it contains typical uncertainty sources and their values. Medjil also allows to setup a user (company) specific uncertainty budget(s) based on the default which is used for calibrations instead of the default one. During the setup process user can delete, modify or add additional error sources.</p>
        <img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_4_1.png" alt="Uncertainty budgets">
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p><b>Name</b> = Custom uncertainty budget name. Uncertainty budgets are identified by a name that must be unique</p>
        <p><b>Company</b> = The owner of the new uncertainty budget. The new budget(s) are accessible to any user within that company.</p>
        <p><b>Std Dev Used When Statistically Zero</b> = This value is used to overruled (overwrite) any standard deviation equal to zero. For example Medjil uses the sample standard deviation of observation sets composed of measurements between the same pillars to calculate an uncertainty of the EDMI measurements. When all measurements in the one observation set are the same or if there is only one measurement in the observation set, the sample standard deviation is mathematically zero.</p>
        <p><b>Type</b> = Definition of uncertainty type. Type A means a statistically derived component or uncertainty where Type B stands for any other derivation of uncertainty e.g. calibration report, manufacturer's specification or an estimate based on experience.</p>
        <p><b>Distribution</b> = Definition of distribution associated with the uncertainty. A normal distribution is most associated with continuous univariate distributions such as many random variables.             
             A rectangular distribution represents an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bound (equal probability anywhere within the range). For example rounding of a physical quantity or a resolution of digital instrument.</p>
        <p><b>Uncertainty</b> = The expanded uncertainty at 95% confidence in the units specified for the uncertainty source.</p>
        <p><b>K</b> = The coverage factor used to scale and expand the uncertainty from one standard deviation (68% confidence) to 95% confidence level. Typically 2.0 for a normal distribution or sqrt(3) for a rectangular distribution. Medjil will auto complete this field as the distribution drop-down is changed but the user still has the ability to overwrite this field.</p>
        <p><b>Dof</b> = Degrees of freedom. For a Type A uncertainty this is equal to the number of measurements minus the number of unknowns (redundant measurements). For a Type B uncertainty Dof needs to be estimated. The following can be used as a guide: 3 for not very confident, 10 for moderate confidence, 30 for very confident.</p>
        <p><b>Group</b> = Uncertainty sources are categorised into 11 different groups. The group selected for an uncertainty source will affect the following:</p>    
        <ul STYLE="margin:30px">

        <p>The following tests assume a confidence level of 1 − α = 0.95 (95%) and a number of degrees of freedom (ν) based on number of redundant measurements.</p>
        <h3>7.1.1 Hypothesis A</h3>
        <p>This null hypothesis states that the calculated experimental standard deviation, s, is smaller than or equal to the manufacturers specifications value &sigma;.</p>
        <p>The null hypothesis is not rejected if the following condition is fulfilled:</p>
        <div>$$ s_0\le\sigma\times\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{1-\alpha}^2(\nu)}{\nu}}\ \ \ \ (Eq. 7.1) $$</div>
        <p>Otherwise, the null hypothesis is rejected.</p>
        <h3>7.1.2 Hypothesis B</h3>
        <p>    The null hypothesis states that the experimental standard deviation, s belong to the same population as the standard deviation (&#x3B5;&#x303;) obtained in the previous calibrations using the same instrumentation.</p>
        <p>The null hypothesis is not rejected if the following condition is fulfilled:</p>
        <div>$$ \frac{1}{F_{1-\alpha/2}\left(v,v\right)}\le\frac{s_0^2}{{\widetilde{\varepsilon}}_0^2}\le F_{1-\alpha/2}\left(v,v\right)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 7.2) $$</div>        
        <p>Otherwise, the null hypothesis is rejected.</p>
        <h3>7.1.2 Hypothesis C</h3>
        <p>The null hypothesis states that the zero-point correction, δ, is equal to zero as supplied by the manufacturer (δ = 0)? Or, if prisms with a given zero-point correction, δ<sub>0</sub> are used, is δ = δ<sub>0</sub>?</p>
        <p>The null hypothesis is not rejected if the following condition is fulfilled:</p>
        <div>$$ |δ-δ_0 |≤s_δ×t_{1-α/2} (ν)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 7.3) $$</div>
