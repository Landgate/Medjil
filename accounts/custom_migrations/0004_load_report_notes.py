The uncertainty value applies at the time of measurement only and takes no account of any effects that may apply afterwards.
Baseline measurements were performed in accordance with the ISO17123-4:2012 Optics and optical instruments – Field procedures for testing geodetic and surveying instruments – Part 4: Electro-optical distance meters (EDM measurements to reflectors)"""},
