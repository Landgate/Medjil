<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) instruments (EDM and prism => EDMI)  are commonly used for measuring length. Regular calibration of these instruments is required to ensure the distances measured by these instruments are legally traceable back to the national and international standards. It is recommended  EDMI should be calibrated every 6 months or after service or repair.</p>

<p>This EDMI calibration portal enables users to calibrate their instruments using one of the following calibration baselines:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Curtin University, Kent St, Bentley, 24hrs 7days a week</li>
<li>Kalgoorlie Explosives Reserve, Piccadilly St, 7am to 3pm, Mon-Fri. Booking required</li>
<li>Busselton Bypass 24hrs 7days a week</li>
</ul>

<p>Landgate re-calibrates EDM baselines every two years or as required. Check the EDM Baseline <i>Regulation 13</i> certificate for details.</p>

<h1>2. Definitions</h1>
<p><b>National Measurement Institute (NMI)</b> - is a Commonwealth statutory authority established in 2004, operating under the National Measurement Act 1960.  The Institute is responsible for advising the Government on the scientific, technical and legislative requirements of Australia's national measurement system and has specific responsibilities for co-ordinating the national measurement system for legal metrology.</p>
<p><b>Verifying Authority</b> - the NMI appoints verifying authorities under Regulation 71 and 73 of the National Measurement Regulations 1999 in accordance with the National Measurement Act 1960.  Verifying authorities are appointed where there is a need for legally traceable measurement. </p>
<p><b>Legally Traceable Measurement</b> - under the National Measurement Act 1960 measurements made for a legal purpose must be able to be traced back to the National Reference Standard.</p>
<p><b>Legal Metrology</b> - comprises all measurement carried out for legal purpose.  It includes all measurement that is subject to regulation, by law or government decree.</p>
<p><b>Least Square Adjustment</b> - is rigorous method of adjusting redundant measurements which produces the best adjusted values and associated uncertainties.</p>

<h1>3. Instrument Calibration Procedure</h1>
<h2>3.1 Introduction</h2>

<p>There are a number of sources of error inherent in surveying equipment. The three distinct systematic errors, which may occur in EDM instruments are:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Zero constant or index error</li>
<li>Scale error</li>
<li>Cyclic or short periodic error</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure, know as EDMI calibration, is designed to identify the above errors and to determine instrument constants and errors (instrument correction). Tis is achieved by conducting a series of measurements on a certified baseline.</p> 

<p>Note: It is beyond the scope of this procedure to identify all sources of error inherent in surveying equipment. Surveyors should be aware of the limitations of the equipment they use and ensure that it is well maintained and regularly checked.</p>

<h2>3.2 Legislative Requirements</h2>
<p>Matters relating to the uncertainty of surveys are detailed in Regulation 5 of the <i>Licensed Surveyors (General Surveying Practice) Regulation 1961</i>.</p>

<p>Matters relating to EDMI calibration are detailed in Regulation 20 of the <i>Licensed Surveyors (General Surveying Practice) Regulation 1961</i>.</p>

<h2>3.3 Verification of EDMI Errors</h2>
<h3>3.3.1  Zero Constant or Index Error</h3>

<p>Distances measured by a EDMI (combination of instrument and reflector) are subject to a constant error caused by the following three factors:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Electrical delays, geometrical detours and eccentricities in the instruments</li>
<li>Differences between the electronic centre and the mechanical centre of the instrument</li>
<li>Differences between the optical and mechanical centres of the reflector</li>
</ul>

<p>Once determined the value needs to be applied directly to every measurement. Note: Constant error applies only to a tested combination of instrument and reflector and it needs to be checked after changes of reflector, or after jolts, or instrument mounting or after service.</p>

<h3>3.3.2 Scale error</h3>
<p>Scale error is proportional to the length of the distance measured and is caused by:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Internal frequency errors, including those caused by external temperature and instrument "warm up" effects</li>
<li>Uncertainty of measured temperature, pressure and humidity which affect the velocity of the propagation</li>
<li>Non-homogeneous emissions/reception patterns from the emitting and receiving diodes (phase inhomogeneities)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3.3 Cyclic error</h3>
<p>The precision of an EDM instrument dependents on the precision of the internal phase measurement. Unwanted interference either through electronic/optical cross talk or multi-path effects of the transmitted signal onto the received signal causes cyclic error.  The major form of the cyclic error is sinusoidal with a wavelength equal to the unit length of the instrument. The unit length is the scale on which the EDM instrument measures the distance and is derived from the fine measuring frequency.  Unit length is equal to one half of the modulation wavelength (Rueger 1984).  The magnitude of the cyclic error can be of the order of 5 - 10 mm, but it will vary depending on the actual length measured.</p>

<h2>3.4 EDM Baselines provided in Western Australia</h2>
<h3>3.4.1 Curtin University Baseline</h3>

<p>In 1995 the Surveyor General reconditioned a ten-pillar baseline at Curtin University which had been in use for approximately ten years.  Renovation included the placement of two additional pillars making the baseline a twelve-pillar baseline.  New stainless steel pillar plate tops were provided to all pillars, with a 5/8" Whitworth threaded bolt at the centre of each pillar top. This baseline is situated on Curtin University property parallel to Kent Street, Bentley. The baseline is partially accessible by vehicles at all times via the track alongside the baseline.  Permission is not necessary to use the baseline.  Any conflict of usage should be decided on a first to occupy basis. The Curtin University contact is Ahmed El-Mowafy, Director of Graduate Research phone 9266 3403, mobile 0403165643 or Email a.el-mowafy@curtin.edu.au. When contacting Curtin by Email please cc Petra Helmholz into the conversation.</p>

<h3>3.4.2 Kalgoorlie Baseline</h3>

<p>This EDM calibration baseline is situated on the Department of Mines and Petroleum Resources Explosives Reserve in Piccadilly Street, Kalgoorlie. The Kalgoorlie baseline consists of eight pillars set out such that all pillars are colinear. The baseline is readily accessible to 2WD vehicles when dry and is situated in a non-volatile area of the reserve. Phone in advance to ensure access 9091 7590.  Any conflict of usage should be decided on a first to occupy basis.</p>

<h3>3.4.3 Busselton Baseline</h3>
<p>This EDM calibration baseline is situated on the Busselton Bypass west of Redgum Way and east of the Bussell Highway. The baseline consists of six pillars set out such that all pillars are colinear. The baseline is readily accessible to all vehicles. The baseline is accessible by vehicles at all times via the track alongside the length of the baseline.  Permission is not necessary to use the baseline.  Any conflict of usage should be decided on a first to occupy basis.</p>

<h2>3.5 Minimum Standard for the Uncertainty of Calibration</h2>
<p>Recommendation No 8 of the Working Party of the National Standards Commission on the calibration of Electromagnetic Distance Measuring (EDM) equipment in 1983 states that the minimum standard for the uncertainty of calibrations of an EDM instrument should be:</p>
<p>± (4.0mm + 20ppm)     (5.1)</p>
<p>at the 95% confidence level.  This recommendation means that an instrument correction is derived for a distance meter/reflector combination from measurements on a certified EDM baseline and that the uncertainty (against the National Standard) of this instrument correction (IC) shall not exceed ± (4.0mm + 20ppm).  Subsequent to a calibration, the derived instrument correction is applied to distance measurements, thus bringing the distance meter readings in line with the National Standard of length.  In terms of standard deviation, the instrument correction must be accurate to at least</p>
<p>± (2.0mm + 12ppm)     (5.2)</p>
<p>It is important to realise that the uncertainty and standard deviations listed above refer to the accuracy of the instrument correction and not to the precision of a distance measurement.  The expression at (5.2) does not relate in any way with the accuracy specification quoted by manufacturers for their instruments.</p>

<h2>3.6 Verification Method</h2>
<p>The verification method involves the measurement of a set of distances between pillars on the EDM baseline to determine the existence and magnitude of any errors present.</p>

<h2>3.7 Verification Procedures</h2>
<p>Booking sheets for the Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton baselines are available.</p>

<h3>3.7.1 Measurement procedure on baselines</h3>
<p>Ascertain the unit length of the instrument (half of the modulation wavelength of the fine measurement) and record on the booking sheet. This length should be provided under the technical specifications for the instrument in the manufacturer's handbook.</p>

<h3>3.7.2 Sequence of measurements for a complete verification</h3>
<h4>3.7.2.1 Curtin University Baseline</h4>

<p>Place EDM on pillar 2 and measure to pillars 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11B and 12 in turn. Then shift EDM to pillar 3 and measure to pillars 12, 11B, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 in turn. This sequence requires the reflector to be moved up and down the line only once. Then follow 3.7.2.4.</p>

<h4>3.7.2.2 Kalgoorlie Baseline</h4>
<p>Place EDM on pillar 1 and measure to pillars 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in turn. Then shift EDM to pillar 2 and measure to pillars 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 in turn. This sequence requires the reflector to be moved up and down the line only once. Then follow 3.7.2.4.</p>

<h4>3.7.2.3 Busselton Baseline</h4>
<p>Place EDM on pillar 1 and measure to pillars 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in turn. Then shift EDM to pillar 2 and measure to pillars 6, 5, 4, 3 and 1 in turn. This sequence requires the reflector to be moved up and down the line only once. Then follow 3.7.2.4.</p>

<h4>3.7.2.4 Procedure for all Baselines</h4>
<ol STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Complete EDM instrument 'check and adjust' as per manufacturer instruction.</li>
<li>EDM instruments, thermometer and barometer are to be shaded by an umbrella in sunny and rainy conditions. Only one thermometer and barometer is required. A psychrometer or digital weather station may be used to measure relative humidity for a more accurate determination of atmospheric correction (not relevant to all EDM's). Ensure meteorological equipment has stabilised before making observations.</li>
<li>Level EDM instrument and reflector carefully on all stations.  Start with all foot screws in the mid position. The stainless steel pillar tops have been set level on pillars.</li>
<li>Measure all heights to the instrument and prism from the pillar plate accurately to 1mm.</li>
<li>The instrument should remain switched on during the whole calibration process.</li>
<li>The same reflector, reflector mounting and tribrach should be used for all measurements.  The reflector must have a unique identification (serial number) which must be entered on the booking sheet.</li>
<li>All calibration measurements can be taken in either daytime or night-time but a mixture of day and night measurements is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Meteorological field equipment will have current calibration status.</li>
<li>On each line, four separate distance measurements should be taken as a minimum, with re-pointing after each measurement. </li>
<li>Atmospheric Correction Control - Atmospheric corrections using corrected observed temperature and pressure should be entered into the EDM instrument.  This is essential for Pulsed EDM instruments.  Temperatures and pressure should be noted for every distance measured.  Observers must note on the booking sheet whether the atmospheric correction control (PPM) is set to zero, or has been set according to the prevailing temperature and pressure.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2.8 Reduction and Interpretation</h2>
<p>This portal has been developed by Landgate for the calibration of EDM instruments against baselines.</p>
<p>The calibration results and measurements for each EDM instrument and baseline are stored in a database for future reference and legal traceability.  The Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton baseline details have already been included in the database, but additional baselines may be added.  A selection of EDM instruments and reflector makes and models are also included.</p>
<p>The instrument details and measured distances are entered interactively by the operator.  After the observed data is reduced to obtain horizontal distances and their associated variances, a least squares adjustment is performed. The adjustment is performed according to ISO standard.</p>
<p>The portal produces report for analysing instrument calibration details. A final report which summarises the results of an EDI calibration is produced.</p> 
<p>The minimum standards for the uncertainty of calibration are described in terms of Recommendation No.8 of the working party of the National Standards Commission on the calibration of EDM Equipment of 1 February 1983.  All uncertainties are specified at the 95% confidence level. </p>
