<h1>1. Preamble</h1>
<p>The Landgate provides barcode staff calibration range (the Range) located at the Land Surveyors Licensing Board's examination site at Boya. The site consists of 2 observing pillars and a series of 21 stainless steel pins set in a solid granite outcrop.</p>

<p>The pins have been placed at optimum distances from the observing pillars and allows for calibrating staff up to 4 metre height. 

<p>The relative height differences between the pins have been accurately determined by repeat observations using precision levels and calibrated invar staves. Landgate regularly re-observes the Range to ensure its accuracy. This portal provides ensure staves are calibrated based on a time-dependent (most up to date) calibration range.</p>

<p>Before commencing the field procedure refer to the following documents:</p>

<h1>2. Stave calibration procedure</h1>
<h2>2.1 Use the barcode staff booking sheet to record the collimation details and range observations details in the field.</h2>
<h2>2.2 Check the bubble of the digital level and the staff. Re-adjust them if necessary. The staff needs to be truly vertical for the best results.</h2>
<h2>2.3 Perform a collimation test on the digital level and use its software to compute and store the constants calculated. For this purpose, four co-linear spikes in concrete 20 m apart have been established adjacent to the range (see the Access Sketch).</h2>
<h2>2.4 Configure the settings in the digital level to record mean and standard deviation of observations from multiple readings (at least five), if possible. Otherwise, if the instrument does not allow means from multiple observations, a minimum of three complete sets of observations (see 8 â€“ 10 below) is required to achieve sufficient redundancy.</h2>
<h2>2.5 After completing the collimation test set the digital level on the highest observing pillar (MV 83) and shade it from the sun. Pillar B (low pillar) is only utilised by Landgate when calibrating the range.</h2>
<h2>2.6 Position staff on the highest pin (Pin No 1) and allow at least 5 minutes to settle and adjust to the ambient air temperature. Record the air temperature in the booking sheet with the shaded thermometer.</h2>
<h2>2.7 A complete set of observations for a standard four metre staff consist of:</h2>
<h3>2.7.1 Set up digital level instrument on Pillar MV 83</h3>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Backsight to the staff at Pin Number 1</li>
<li>Intermediate sights to the staff at Pin Numbers 2 to 20</li>
<li>Foresight to the staff at Pin Number 21</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.8 A set complete set of observations for a standard three metre staff consist of:</h2>
<h3>2.8.1 Set up digital level instrument on Pillar MV 83</h3>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Backsight to the staff at Pin Number 1</li>
<li>Intermediate sights to the staff at Pin Numbers 2 to 14</li>
<li>Foresight to the staff at Pin Number 15</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.8.2 Setup on Pillar B</h3>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Backsight to the staff at Pin Number 7</li>
<li>Intermediate sights to the staff at Pin Numbers 8 to 20</li>
<li>Foresight to the staff at Pin Number 21</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.8 Record the air temperature in the booking sheet at the end of each survey.</h2>
<h2>2.9 Download the level data and create a csv file in the correct format.</h2>
<h2>2.10 Click here to process your staff readings and print the pdf report.</h2>

<h1>3. Sample data format</h1>
<p>Data should be uploaded in a correctly formatted text or csv file as per the file format. All fields are separated by a comma and must have a header line</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Field 1 = Pin number</li>
<li>Field 2 = Staff reading</li>
<li>Field 3 = Number of readings</li>
<li>Field 4 = Standard deviations</li>
</ul>
