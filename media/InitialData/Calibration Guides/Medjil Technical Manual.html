<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Medjil portal was developed by the Department of Land Information of Western Australia (LANDGATE) in collaboration with other jurisdictions. The portal allows the calibration of</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>EDM Baselines using standardised instrument</li>
<li>EDM Instrumentation using standardised EDM Baseline</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of calibrating the EDM Instrumentation (EDMI) is to establish the legal traceability of a user's instrument to the national standard of length provided by the National Measurment Institute (NMI). This is accomplished by determining the Instrument Correction and its expanded uncertainty (at 95% confidence level) through a survey procedure conducted at a certified EDM Baseline. The verifying authorities of the States and Territories maintain the certification of EDM Baselines.</p>
<p>The certification (calibration) of EDM baselines establishes updated or improved distances between its pillars. EDM Baslines and EDMI calibration should be conducted on regular basis. The calibration of an EDMI provides instrument specific distance correction to be applied to measurements taken by this instrument.</p>
<p>The Medjil portal offers tools and reports for both EDM Baseline and EDMI calibrations. Please refer to the specific guides that provide field calibration instructions.</p>
<p>This document contains reference information, including mathematical equations, procedures, algorithms, and computations adopted by the portal. The calibration procedures are based on the following resources:</p>

<p>The Draft Verifying Authorities (VA) Handbook 2001 is intended for use by verifying authorities which are appointed under the provisions of Regulation 73 of the National Measurement Regulations 1999 in accordance with the National Measurement Act 1960 to verify reference standards of measurements under the provisions of Regulation 13, 30 and 31. The determination of the a priori standard deviations and the analysis of uncertainties of EDM measurements are based on the general guidelines within this handbook.</p>
<p>The minimum standards for the uncertainty of an EDMI calibration are described in terms of Recommendation No,8 of the Working Party of the National Standards Commission on the calibration of EDM Equipment of 1 February, 1983. All uncertainties are specified at the 95% confidence level. Users have the flexibility to adopt or modify default uncertainties and associated traceability statements as required.

<!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
<h1>1 EDM Baseline calibration</h1>
<div id="Chapter_1_1"></div>
<h2>1.1 EDM Baseline designs</h2>
<p>Since the introduction of EDM instruments, the EDM Baseline has been the preferred calibration method. There are three different EDM Baseline designs:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Heerbrugg Design</li>
<li>Aarau Design</li>
<li>Hobart Design</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the EDM Baseline designs aims to achieve an equal distribution of measured distances between the shortest and longest lines without any repetitions. They also allow EDMI calibration with or without known distances (certified baseline distances), with the exception of the Hobart design, which requires the distances to be known beforehand. Most baseline designs incorporate a multiple of a basic unit length of EDM instrument. A detailed explanation of baseline design concepts is beyond the scope of this manual. For detailed baseline design information, please refer to the "Electronic Distance Measurement" book by J.M. Rueger.</p>
<p>The current version of Medjil portal requires distances to be known for all types of baselines to perform EDMI calibration. This approach is essential for ensuring distance traceability to the national standard. Therefore, EDM baselines must be calibrated using NMI certified instruments to determine the certified distances before proceeding with EDMI calibration. An additional module could potentially be developed to enable EDMI calibration without known distances. However, it is important to note that such calibrations cannot be certified under the NMI Act, and the EDMI distances obtained in this manner are not legally traceable to the national standard.</p>
<div id="Chapter_1_2"></div>
<h2>1.2 Mathematical model and observation equations for the calibration of EDM Baseline</h2>
<p>By deriving two observation equations, we can ensure that distances remain non-negative and, at the same time, increase the flexibility of the EDM Baseline survey:</p>
<div>$$ D_{ij}=x_j-x_i-zpc\ \ \ for\ j > i\ \ \ (Eq. 1.1)$$ </div>
<div>$$ D_{ij}=x_i-x_j-zpc\ \ \ for\ j < i\ \ \ (Eq. 1.2)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D<sub>ij</sub> = Measured distance between pillars i and j (the observation)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>i</sub> = Distance from the first pillar to pillar 'i'. Distance corrected for the pillar ofsets and reduced to baseline reference height</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;x<sub>j</sub> = Distance from the first pillar to pillar 'j'. Distance corrected for the pillar ofsets and reduced to baseline reference height</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;zpc = Zero point correction (an additive constant of the certified EDMI)</p>
<div id="Chapter_1_3"></div>
<h2>1.3 Example: Formation of observation equations</h2>
<p>Consider the following example baseline consisting of 4 pillars:</p>
<img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_1_1.png" alt="Example basline">
<br>
<br>
<p>The following set of linear observation equations can be formed according to Eq. 1.1 and Eq. 1.2:</p>
<div>$$ \begin{matrix}D_{12}=&{+X}_2&&&-zpc\\D_{13}=&&{+X}_3&&-zpc\\D_{14}=&&&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{21}=&{+X}_2&&&-zpc\\D_{23}=&-X_2&+X_3&&-zpc\\D_{24}=&-X_2&&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{31}=&&+X_3&&-zpc\\D_{32}=&-X_2&{+X}_3&&-zpc\\D_{34}=&&-X_3&{+X}_4&-zpc\\D_{41}=&&&+X_4&-zpc\\D_{42}=&-X_2&&+X_4&-zpc\\D_{43}=&&-X_3&+X_4&-zpc\\\end{matrix}\ \ \ (Eq. 1.3)$$ </div>
<p>In matrix notation, the observation equations can be represented as as D = AX:</p>
<div>$$ \left[\begin{matrix}D_{12}\\D_{13}\\D_{14}\\D_{21}\\D_{23}\\D_{24}\\D_{31}\\D_{32}\\D_{34}\\D_{41}\\D_{42}\\D_{43}\\\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}1&0&0&-1\\0&1&0&-1\\0&0&1&-1\\1&0&0&-1\\-1&1&0&-1\\-1&0&1&-1\\0&1&0&-1\\-1&1&0&-1\\0&-1&1&-1\\0&0&1&-1\\-1&0&1&-1\\0&-1&1&-1\\\end{matrix}\right]\left[\begin{matrix}X_2\\X_3\\X_4\\zpc\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 1.4)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D<sub>ij</sub> = Measured distance between pillars i and j (vector of the observations)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;A = The design matrix
<p>&emsp;&emsp;X = The certified distances and zpc (vector of the unknown output estimates)</p>
<p>This approach eliminates the need to provide approximate distances between pillars. In accordance with Section (5), the observations, along with their a-priori uncertainties (p), undergo a least squares adjustment to obtain the estimated certified distances d<sub>x</sub> and the zpc values, along with the complete VCV matrix.</p>
<div id="Chapter_1_4"></div>
<h2>1.4 Inter-pillar distances survey</h2>
<img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_1_3.png" alt="Inter-pillar distances survey">
<p>To calibrate an EDM baseline, a series of inter-pillar distance measurements (surveys) are necessary, which should include atmospheric observations of the conditions during the survey. Medjil mandates that all instrumentation used in the survey must be calibrated and possess a current certificate stating the uncertainty of the instrument readings and the calibration corrections that can be applied. The uncertainty of instrument readings plays a crucial role in propagating uncertainties for the inter-pillar distance survey.</p>
<p>The distance observations are assumed to be slope distances that have not been corrected for the height of instrument or height of targets. Applying atmospheric corrections by entering these into the instrument is optional but Medjil requires temperature, pressure and humidity for every distance measurement even if this has been entered into the instrument. These values are used for estimating the propagation of uncertinty as well as the optional applying of atmospheric corrections in case it was not entered into the instrument during the survey.</p>
<p>It is recommended each distance (bay) d<sub>ij</sub> (where i = from_pillar; j = to_pillar) should be measured four times. However, Medjil allows the number of repeat measurements to vary between bays and between surveys. The pillar survey data is to be provided in an ASCII file and must contain the following fields:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>from_pillar: Pillar name as defined in Medjil calibration sites</li>
<li>to_pillar: Pillar name as defined in Medjil calibration sites</li>
<li>height_of_instrument: height in metres</li>
<li>height_of_target: height in metres</li>
<li>horizontal_direction(dd): angle in decimal degrees</li>
<li>slope_distance: distance in metres</li>
<li>temperature: temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
<li>pressure: pressure in Hectopascals or millibars</li>
<li>humidity: humidity in percentage</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to this <a href = "\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\BUSS_baseline_calibration_edm_observations.csv" target = "_self">sample dataset</a> required for an EDM baseline calibration survey data format.</p>
<br>
<p>Baseline measurements must be performed in accordance with the ISO17123-4:2012 Optics and optical instruments – Field procedures for testing geodetic and surveying instruments – Part 4: Electro-optical distance meters (EDM measurements to reflectors).</p>
<div id="Chapter_1_5"></div>
<h2>1.5 Pillar offsets survey</h2>
<p>The pillar offset survey determines offset of each pillar from the alignment of the first (1) and last pillar (n). Medjil performs the required reduction of observations during the EDM Baseline calibration process. Each survey setup is used to automatically calculate the pillar offset providing the survey setup includes measurements to pillar 1 and pillar n.</p>
<img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_1_2.png" alt="Pillar Offsets">
<p>For each pillar setup, an arbitrary set of coordinates (E<sub>j</sub>, N<sub>j</sub>) are calculated for all pillars observed according to the formula:</p>
<div>$$\left[E_j,N_j\right]=\ Polar2Reclangular\left(Hz_{ij},d_{ij}\right)\ \ \ (Eq. 1.5)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;d<sub>ij</sub> = horizontal distance (in metres) corrected for calibration parameters and atmospheric corrections between pillars i and j</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Hz<sub>ij</sub> = angular direction observed at pillar i to pillar j</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;[E<sub>j</sub>,N<sub>j</sub>] = set of arbitrary coordinates (Easting and Northing) of pillar j</p>
<p>Then the offset of pillar j is calculated according to:</p>
<div>$$O_j=d_{j}sin\left(A_{1n}-A_{j}\right)\ \ \ (Eq. 1.6)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;d<sub>j</sub> = horizontal distance between pillars i and j</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;A<sub>j</sub> = derived bearing using coordinates of pillars: E<sub>1</sub>,N<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>j</sub>,N<sub>j</sub>
</p>
<p>As the instrument moves between pillars, pillar 1 and pillar n are observed in each setup. This allows the orientation of all setups in the survey and computation of an offset for each pillar from every pillar setup that included observations to pillar 1 and pillar n. Medjil automatically computes the average pillar offset and standard deviation values from the distance survey data. Table 4.4 demonstrates an example set of pillar offsets.</p>
<div id="Chapter_1_6"></div>
<h2>1.6 Pillar heights survey</h2>
<p>Pillar heights (H<sub>j</sub>) are to be determined as orthometric heights (eg. AHD) using spirit levelling survey or other suitable method and provided with standard deviations preferably derived from redundant observations. Level data is to be provided in an ASCII file. Refer to this 
<a href = "\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\BUSS_ baseline_calibration_level_observations.csv" target = "_self">sample dataset</a> for the required data format.</p>
<p>Pillar coordinates and heights are required and used to determine the baseline location in order to derive geometric correction to the distances. Medjil uses an average value of the supplied pillar coordinates to calculate the geometric corrections for surveys. (See section 3.3)</p>

<h1>2 EDM Instrumentation calibration</h1>
<div id="Chapter_2_1"></div>
<h2>2.1 Systematic errors in EDM instruments</h2>
<p>There are three distinct systematic errors which may occur in EDM instruments. The calibration of an instrument on a certified baseline allows to determine the specific instrument - prism correction that can eliminate of the following errors:</p>
<div id="Chapter_2_1_1"></div>
<h3>2.1.1 Zero Point Correction (zpc)</h3>
<p>All distances measured by a particular EDM instrument and reflector combination (EDMI) are subject to a constant error caused by the following factors:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Electrical delays, geometrical detours and eccentricities in the instruments</li>
<li>Differences between the electronic centre and the mechanical centre of the instrument</li>
<li>Differences between the optical and mechanical centres of the reflector (prism)</li>
</ul>
<p>This errors may vary with changes of reflector, or after jolts, or with different instrument mountings. Zpc is an algebraic constant applied directly to every measurement.<p>
<div id="Chapter_2_1_2"></div>
<h3>2.1.2 Scale Correction Factor (scf)</h3>
<p>Scale Correction Factor is proportional to the length of the distance measured and is caused by:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Internal frequency errors, including those caused by external temperature and instrument “warm up” effects</li>
<li>Errors of measured temperature, pressure and humidity affect the velocity (and path?) of the electromagnetic wave</li>
<li>Non-homogeneous emissions/reception patterns from the emitting and receiving diodes (phase inhomogeneities)</li>
</ul>
<div id="Chapter_2_1_3"></div>
<h3>2.1.3 Cyclic Errors</h3>
<p>The precision of an EDM instrument dependents on the precision of the internal phase measurements. Unwanted interference through electronic/optical cross talk or multi-path effects of the transmitted signal on to the received signal causes cyclic errors. The major form of the cyclic error is sinusoidal with a wavelength equal to the unit length of the instrument. The unit length is the scale on which the EDM instrument measures the distance and is derived from the fine measuring frequency. Unit length is equal to one half of the modulation wavelength.</p>
<div id="Chapter_2_2"></div>
<h2>2.2 Mathematical model of the EDM Instrument Correction (IC)</h2>
<div>$$ IC=zpc+scf*D+1C\sin{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+2C\cos{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+3C\sin{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+4C\cos{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)}}}}\ \ \ (Eq. 2.1)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;IC = Instrument Correction</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D = Distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;zpc = Zero Point Correction</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;scf = Scale Correction Factor (1:x)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;U = Instrument Unit Length (m) - wavelength/2</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;1C, 2C, 3C and 4C = Cyclic (short periodic) parameters</p>
<p>By default Medjil estimates only zpc and scf. However, Medjil is also capable of solving for cyclic error parameters (1C,2C,3C,4C) which are depend on wavelength cycle errors. Solving for cyclic error however, is optional as the ability to detect this error reliably depends on the baseline design.
User should perform additional calibration on "cyclic error" testline if the instrument callibration was performed on Aarau baseline design or Heerbrugg or Hobart design, which was not designed for the unit length of the distance meter being callibrated or the accuracy of the cyclic errors determined on Heerbrugg or Hobart type baselines is not sufficient.</p>
<div id="Chapter_2_3"></div>
<h2>2.3 Observation equations</h2>
<p>For every distance measured on a EDM baseline the following observation equation can be derived:</p>
<div>$$ v_i=zpc+scf*D^C_i+1C\sin{\left(2\pi\frac{D_i}{U}\right)+2C\cos{\left(2\pi\frac{D_i}{U}\right)+3C\sin{\left(4\pi\frac{D_i}{U}\right)+4C\cos{\left(4\pi\frac{D_i}{U}\right)}}}}+(D^C_i-D_i)\ \ \ (Eq. 2.2)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;v<sub>i</sub> = Residual is the difference between cetrtified distance and the adjusted observed distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D<sub>i</sub> = Observed distance</p>
<div>$$D_i^C\ \ \ = Certified baseline distance $$ </div>
<p>The angular values (sin and cos values) are expressed in radians.</p>
<p>Further the n observation equations for all distances measured on a certified baseline can be expressed in a matrix form as</p>
<div>$$ V = AX + W\ \ \ (Eq. 2.3)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<div>$$ V=\left[\begin{matrix}v_1\\v_2\\...\\v_n\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 2.4)$$ </div>
<div>$$ A=\left[\begin{matrix}1&D_1&\sin{2\pi\frac{D_1}{U}}&\cos{2\pi\frac{D_1}{U}}&\sin{4\pi\frac{D_1}{U}}&\cos{4\pi\frac{D_1}{U}}\\1&D_2&\sin{2\pi\frac{D_2}{U}}&\cos{2\pi\frac{D_2}{U}}&\sin{4\pi\frac{D_2}{U}}&\cos{4\pi\frac{D_2}{U}}\\...&...&...&...&...&...\\1&D_n&\sin{2\pi\frac{D_n}{U}}&\cos{2\pi\frac{D_n}{U}}&\sin{4\pi\frac{D_n}{U}}&\cos{4\pi\frac{D_n}{U}}\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 2.5)$$ </div>
<div>$$ W=\left[\begin{matrix}D_1^C-D_1\\D_2^C-D_2\\\ldots\\D_n^C-D_n\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 2.6)$$ </div>
<div>$$ X=\left[\begin{matrix}zpc\\scf\\1C\\2C\\3C\\4C\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 2.7)$$ </div>
<p>A weight matrix can also be determined for the observed distances as:</p>
<div>$$ p=\left[\begin{matrix}p_1&0&0&0\\0&p_2&0&0\\...&...&...&...\\0&0&0&p_n\\\end{matrix}\right]\ \ \ (Eq. 2.8)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<div>$$ p_i=\frac{1}{S_{D_i}^2}\ \ \ (Eq. 2.9)$$ </div>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>D</sub> = a priori standard deviation of the measured distance D</p>
<p>Refer to Section (4) for the derivation of the uncertainties of a measured distance. The observations together with a-priori uncertainties (p) are least squares adjusted as per Section (5). Note the weight matrix has the option to be additionally scaled by a variance factor.</p>

<h1>3 Corrections</h1>
<div id="Chapter_3_1"></div>
<h2>3.1 Calibration Correction</h2>
<p>Medjil maintains an instrument register that catalogues all instruments used for calibrations. Instrument register belongs to an individual company. The registry includes the archive of calibration certificates for EDMI, Barometer, Thermometer and Hygrometer. If calibration corrections have not been applied to instrument readings, Medjil allows calibration corrections to be applied to the raw readings during the Medjil calibration.</p>
<div id="Chapter_3_1_1"></div>
<h3>3.1.1 Meteorological instrumentation corrections</h3>
<p>All meteorological instruments (thermometer, barometer, hygrometer) corrections apply as zero point correction (zpc) to the EDMI readings (distance)</p>
<div>c<sub>M</sub> = zpc</div>
<div id="Chapter_3_1_2"></div>
<h3>3.1.2 EDMI correction</h3>
<p>EDMI calibration sourced from the most recent instrument calibration certificate:</p>
<div>c<sub>EDMI</sub> = sfc * d + zpc</div>
<br>
<p>If the meteorological corrections have not been applied to EDMI readings, corrections to atmospheric readings will be applied prior to calculating the first velocity correction.</p>
<div id="Chapter_3_2"></div>
<h2>3.2 Atmospheric correction</h2>
<div id="Chapter_3_2_1"></div>
<h3>3.2.1 First velocity correction (K)</h3>
<div>$$ \mathrm{K\ }=\left[\mathrm{C-}\frac{\mathrm{DP}}{(\mathrm{273.15}+t)}+\frac{\mathrm{11.27e} }{(\mathrm{273.15}+t)}\right]1\mathrm{0}^{\mathrm{-6}}d\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.1)$$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;K = First velocity correction in metres</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;P = Pressure in millibars/hectopascals</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;t = Dry temperature in degrees Celsius</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;d = Distance in metres</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;e = Partial water pressure in hectopascals</p>
<p>$$C = (N_{REF} – 1)10^6$$</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;n<sub>REF</sub> = Reference refractive index (Section 3.2.2)</p>
<p>$$D = (n_G – 1) 10^6 (273.15 / 1013.25)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.2)$$</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;n<sub>G</sub> = Group refractive index of atmosphere for standard conditions</p>
<p>Partial vapour pressure is derived from relative humidity:</>
<div>$$ \mathrm{e\ }=\ \frac{\mathrm{E\ h}}{\mathrm{100}}\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.3) $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;e = Partial water vapour pressure in hectopascals</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;h = Relative humidity in percent</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;E = Saturation water vapour pressure (hPa) at the dry bulb temperature:</p>
<div>$$ \mathrm{E\ }=\ \left[\mathrm{1.0007\ }+\ \left(\mathrm{3.46\ p}\right)10^{-6}\right]\ \times\mathrm{6.1121\ exp}\left[\frac{\mathrm{17.502\ t}}{\left(\mathrm{240.94\ }+\mathrm{\ t}\right)}\right]\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.4) $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;p = Atmospheric pressure in hectopascals</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;t = Dry temperature in degrees Celsius</p>
<div id="Chapter_3_2_2"></div>
<h3>3.2.2 Reference Refractive Index (n<sub>REF</sub>)</h3>
<p>The reference refractive index is instrument specific:</p>
<div>$$ n_{\mathrm{REF}}=\frac{C_O}{\lambda_{\mathrm{MOD\ }}f_{MOD}}=\frac{C_O}{2Uf_{MOD}}\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.5) $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;C<sub>O</sub> = Velocity of light in a vacuum = 299 792 458 m/s</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&#955<sub>MOD</sub> = Constant modulation wavelength of the fine measurements for which the instrument is designed</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;f<sub>MOD</sub> = Constant modulation frequency of the fine measurements</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;U = The exact half of &#955<sub>MOD</sub> , called the unit length of the instrument.</p>
<p>The velocity of light in a vacuum is fixed at 299792458 m/s by the 1983 definition of the SI metre.</p>
<p>The unit length of the instrument (U) and the constant modulation frequency of the fine measurements (f<sub>MOD</sub>) are instrument specific and are generally provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<div id="Chapter_3_2_3"></div>
<h3>3.2.3  Group refractive Index of light in the atmosphere</h3>
<p>In electro-optical EDM, the refractive index is dependent on the wavelength of the visible or infrared radiation. Different frequencies have the same propagation velocity in a vacuum, but not in air because of the interference occurrence between the different frequencies. The signal resulting from the sum of all frequencies will have the so-called group velocity, which is always smaller than the phase velocities of its individual frequencies.</p>
<p>The International Association of Geodesy (IAG) resolved in 1999 at its XXIIth General Assembly in Birmingham that the refractive index in electronic distance measurements (nL) can be calculated using the computer procedure published by Ciddor & Hill in Applied Optics(1999, Vol.38, N0.9, 1663-1667) and Ciddor in Applied Optics (1996, Vol.35, No.9, 1566-1573).</p>
<p>The following closed formulae can be adopted for the computation of the group refractive index in air for electronic distance measurements to within 1 ppm with visible and near infrared waves in the atmosphere:</p>
<div>$$ N_L=\left(n_L-1\right)\mathrm{\mathrm{.1}}0^6=\left(\frac{\mathrm{273.15\ }}{1013.25}.\frac{N_Gp}{(273.15+t)}\right)\mathrm{\mathrm{-}}\left(\frac{1\mathrm{1.27e}}{\left(\mathrm{273.15}+t\right)}\right)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 3.6)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>

The 1.0 ppm stated before makes some allowance for anomalous refractivity and the uncertainty in the determination of the atmospheric parameters.

<h2>3.3 Geometric Corrections</h2>
<p>All certified distances on a calibrated baseline are on the same horizontal plane at a specified reference height and on the same vertical plane running through the first and last pillars.</p>
<p>The geometric corrections contain four components:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Horizontal offset correction</li>
<li>Slope correction</li>
<li>Correction to the specified reference height of the baseline</li>
<li>Chord-to-Arc correction</li>
</ul>
<p>Pillar coordinates and elevation are required and used to determine the baseline location to derive geometric correction of the distances. Medjil computes an average value of the supplied coordinates.</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>The geometric correction equations 3.8 and 3.9 were derived from The Australian Geodetic Datum Technical Manual, National Mapping Council of Australia, Special Publication 10 and are suitable for baselines with steep gradients.</p>
<p>Medjil uses the GRS80 spheroid for determining the mean radius of the earth (R) used in the calculation of the geometric correction. Medjil requires UTM coordinates to be specified for all EDMI calibration pillars. These coordintes are used along with the following formula to determine R for each geometric correction. (GDA2020 technical manual pp. 47)</p>
<div>$$ \mathrm{R\ }=\ \sqrt{pv}\ \ \ (Eq. 3.10) $$</div>

<div id="Chapter_4">
<!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
<h1>4 Uncertainties</h1>
<p>Medjil uses the following terminology:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>‘Uncertainty’ to refers to the GUM’s ‘expanded uncertainty' (95% confidence level or two sigmas)</li>
<li>‘Standard deviation’ refers to the GUM’s ‘standard uncertainty’ (68% confidence level or one sigma)</li>
<li>‘Coverage factor’ numerical factor used as a multiplier of the standard uncertainty in order to obtain an expanded uncertainty</li>
</ul>
<p>Medjil complies with the ISO 17123 (all parts) recommendations to evaluate individual precision (experimental standard deviation known as Type A standard uncertainty) of individual instrument but also to define uncertainty budget which allows for combining all uncertainty components (random or systematic - Type B) to derive combined standard uncertainty (or expanded uncertainty) as a representative measure of accuracy.</p>
<div id="Chapter_4_1"></div>
<h2>4.1 Combined standard and expanded uncertainty</h2>
<p>The combined standard uncertainty C<sub>SU</sub> of a number of individual uncertainty sources (u<sub>i</sub>) is computed using the following formula:</p>
<div>$$ C_{SU}=√(∑_{(i=1)}^n u_{i}^2)\ \ \ (Eq. 4.1)  $$</div>
<p>The combined expanded uncertainty C<sub>EU</sub> is defined as follows:</p>
<div>$$ C_{EU}=C_{SU}k\ \ \ (Eq. 4.2)  $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;k = coverage factor</p>
<div>$$ k=t_{(95\%, v_{eff})}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.3) $$</div>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;v<sub>eff</sub> = effective degrees of freedom</p>
<div>$$ v_{eff}=\frac{s^4}{C_{su}}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.4)  $$</div>
<div>$$ s=∑_{(i=1)}^n\frac{u_{i}^4}{v_i}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.5)  $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;v<sub>i</sub> = degrees of freedom of an uncertainty source (i)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;t = t-student distribution (probability, effective degrees of freedom)</p>
<div id="Chapter_4_2"></div>
<h2>4.2 Uncertainty budget</h2>
<p>An uncertainty budget consists of a table of the uncertainty sources that contribute to the combined uncertainty. Medjil automatically populates some records in the uncertainty budget and allows users to add custom uncertainty sources to the uncertainty budget.</p>
<div id="Chapter_4_2_1"></div>
<h3>4.2.1 Automatically populated uncertainty sources</h3>
Medjil automatically populates the uncertainty sources (Table 4.1 and Table 4.2) when processing the calibration of EDM baselines and EDM Instrumentation.</p>

<p>The values for these automatically populated uncertainty sources are derived as follows:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Certified distances - Least Squares Adjustment (LSA) uncertainty - The uncertainty of each inter-pillar distance is uniquely assigned from the diagonal elements of the Cofactormatrix derived from the least squares adjustment of the baseline calibration. The degrees of freedom is the equal to the degrees of freedom of the calibration of the baseline and the coverage factor is derived from  t-student distribution at 95% and selected degrees of freedom t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub>
</li>
<li>EDM LS zero offset - Zero Point Correction (ZPC) uncertainty - The uncertainty of the zero point correction is assigned from last element of the Cofactormatrix derived from the least squares adjustment of the baseline calibration.  The degrees of freedom is the equal to the degrees of freedom of the calibration of the baseline and the coverage factor is the t-student at 95% and selected degrees of freedom (t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub>)</li>
<li>EDM scale factor - EDMI Reg13 Scale correction factor - The uncertainty, degrees of freedom and coverage factor is assigned from the values specified in the register of calibration certificates of EDM instrument (EDMI). The selected values correspond to the most current certificate (at the time of survey) of the EDMI used for the calibration of the EDM Baseline</li>
<li>EDM scale factor - EDM scale factor (drift over time) - The uncertainty is derived using linear regression of the scale factors from all available calibration certificates of the same EDM Baseline (certified distances). The scale factor is extrapolated at the time of calibration survey and the difference between this value and the last computed value (as per the most current certificate) is adopted as the uncertainty. This uncertainty source is assigned 30 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3</li>
<li>EDMI measurement - Distance Instrument Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half of the instrument measurement increment reading. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li>
<li>EDMI measurement - Linear regression on EDM distance standard deviations - Table 4.3 shows an example of a typical subset of EDMI measurements observed on a EDM Baseline. Measurements with the same ‘From’ and ‘To’ pillar are grouped into sets, then average and standard deviations of these sets are tabulated. The ‘Std Dev Used when statistically zero’ field value defined in the specified Uncertainty Budget of the calibration can be used to exclude and overwrite experimental standard deviations of measurement sets that have all the same values (eg. experimental standard deviations equal to zero).
<br>Linear regression is used on the average ‘slope distance’ and ‘standard deviation’ to derive a formula for the experimental standard deviation of EDMI measurements in the calibration: s<sub>B</sub> = P mm + Q ppm. Where s<sub>B</sub> is the standard deviation of a baseline interval. 
<br>Uncertainties are uniquely assigned to each measurement set as calculated from the derived linear regression equation. This uncertainty source is assigned 30 degrees of freedom and the coverage factor is the t-student at 95% and 30 degrees of freedom t<sub>(95%,30)</sub>
</li>
<li>Heights - Height Differences - During the ‘Calibrate an EDM Baseline’ process, a *.csv file is required to upload the standard uncertainty (standard deviation) of the heights of each pillar. These uncertainties are used to derive the uncertainty of the height differences according to the equation 4.6.</li>
<div>$$ {uc}_{\Delta H}=k\sqrt{\left(H_i^2+H_j^2\right)}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.6)   $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>&#916;H</sub> = Expanded uncertainty of the height difference between pillar i and pillar j
<p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>o</sub> = Expanded uncertainty of the offset between pillar i and pillar j</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;H<sub>j</sub> = Tabulated experimental standard deviation of the ‘To Pillar’</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;k = t<sub>(95%,30)</sub>
</p>
<li>Humidity - Hygrometer calibrated correction factor - Hygrometers used for baseline calibration surveys must have a calibration that indicates the uncertainty of the readings. Medjil will automatically assign a current hygrometer calibration based on the survey date. The uncertainty, coverage factor and degrees of freedom specified for that hygrometer calibration record will be used for the uncertainty ‘Humidity - Hygrometer calibrated correction factor’</li>
<li>Humidity - Hygrometer Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half the measurement increment reading of the instrument used for the calibration. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li>
<li>Offsets - Offsets - Table 4.4 shows the results of a typical alignment survey. The offset of each pillar is surveyed from multiple pillars. The offset results with the same ‘To Pillar’ are grouped into sets, then the average and experimental standard deviations of these sets are tabulated. The uncertainty of each offset is derived from the standard deviation of the offset measurements at both the ‘From Pillar’ and the ‘To Pillar’.
<div>$$ {\rm uc}_o=k\sqrt{\left(o_i^2+o_j^2\right)}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.7)   $$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>o</sub> = Expanded uncertainty of the offset between pillar i and pillar j</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;o<sub>i</sub> = Tabulated experimental standard deviation of the ‘From Pillar’</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;o<sub>j</sub> = Tabulated experimental standard deviation of the ‘To Pillar’</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;k = t<sub>(95%,30)</sub>
</p>
<p>This uncertainty source is assigned 30 degrees of freedom and the coverage factor is the t-student at 95% and 30 degrees of freedom t<sub>(95%,30)</sub>
</p>
<li>Pressure - Barometer calibrated correction factor - Barometers used for calibration surveys must have a calibration that indicates the uncertainty of the readings. Medjil will automatically assign a current barometer calibration based on the survey date. The uncertainty, coverage factor and degrees of freedom specified for that hygrometer calibration will be used for the uncertainty ‘Pressure - Barometer calibrated correction factor’</li>
<li>Pressure - Barometer Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half the measurement increment reading of the instrument used for the calibration. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li>
<li>Temperature - Thermometer calibrated correction factor - Thermometers used for calibration surveys must have a calibration that indicates the uncertainty of the readings. Medjil will automatically assign a current thermometer calibration based on the survey date. The uncertainty, coverage factor and degrees of freedom specified for that hygrometer calibration will be used for the uncertainty ‘Temperature - Thermometer calibrated correction factor’</li>
<li>Temperature - Thermometer Rounding - The uncertainty is equivalent to half the measurement increment reading of the instrument used for the calibration. This uncertainty source is assigned 100 degrees of freedom and a coverage factor of √3.</li>
<li>Certified distances - Uncertainty of Certified Distances - The standard uncertainty of all inter-pillar distances are calculated from the CoFactorMatrix of baseline calibrations. This is done by creating a design matrix for every combination of pillars and calculating another CoFactorMatrix according to the formula:</li>
<div>$$ Q_2=A_2QA_2^T\ \ \ (Eq. 4.8)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Q<sub>2</sub> = The secondary CoFactorMatrix</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Q = The CoFactorMatrix from the LSA of calibrating a baseline</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;A<sub>2</sub> = A design matrix for every possible combination of from and to pillars</p>
<p>The standard uncertainties of all inter-pillar distances are equivalent to the square root of the diagonals of the secondary CoFactorMatrix. These values are stored for each baseline calibration. The inter-pillar distance standard uncertainties that correspond to EDMI calibrations are used to calculate the ‘Uncertainty of Certified Distances’ according to the formula:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>ij</sub> = k * S<sub>ij</sub></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;uc<sub>ij</sub> = Expanded uncertainty of a distance between pillar i and pillar j</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;k = Coverage factor of a baseline calibration determined by the t-student at 95% and LSA derived degree of freedom (dof) t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub>
</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>ij</sub> = Standard uncertainty of a distance between pillar i and pillar j</p>
<li>EDM Calibration - Uncertainty of LSA EDMI Correction - This is a type A uncertainty output by the least squares adjustment used to determine calibration parameters for the calibration of EDM Instrumentation. The uncertainty of the parameters are equivalent to the diagonal elements of the Cofactormatrix. The ‘Uncertainty of (LSA) EDMI Correction’ is calculated according to the following conditions:</li>
<p>(a) if the calibration of the EDMI has tested for cyclic errors and found them to be significant:</p>
<div>$$ S_{IC}=S_{zpc}+S_{scf}D+S_1\sin{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+S_2\cos{\left(2\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+S_3\sin{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)+S_4\cos{\left(4\pi\frac{D}{U}\right)}}}}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.9)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>IC</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the Instrument Correction</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D = Distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>zpc</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the Zero Point Correction (m)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>scf</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the Scale Correction Factor (1:x)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;U = Instrument Unit Length (m)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>1</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the term 1 - Cyclic (1:x)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>2</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the term 2 - Cyclic (1:x)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>3</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the term 3 - Cyclic (1:x)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;S<sub>4</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the term 4 - Cyclic (1:x)</p>
<p> (b) if the calibration of the EDMI has not tested for cyclic errors, has found them to be insignificant:</p>
<div>$$ S_{IC}=S_{zpc}+S_{scf}D\ \ \ (Eq. 4.10)$$ </div>
<p>The uncertainty is calculated according to the following formula:</p>
<div>$$ {uc}_{IC}=k * S_{IC}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.11)   $$</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;u<sub>IC</sub> = Expanded uncertainty of the Instrument Correction</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;k = Coverage factor determined by the t-student at 95% and LSA derived degree of freedom (dof) t<sub>(95%,dof)</sub>

<h3>4.2.2 Custom uncertainty budgets</h3>
<p>Medjil default uncertainty budget is used during the calibration process and it contains typical uncertainty sources and their values. Medjil also allows to setup a user (company) specific uncertainty budget(s) based on the default which is used for calibrations instead of the default one. During the setup process user can delete, modify or add additional error sources.</p>
<img src="\media\TechnicalManual\tbaseline\Tech manual\Picture_4_1.png" alt="Uncertainty budgets">
<p>Where:</p>
<p>
<b>Name</b> = Custom uncertainty budget name. Uncertainty budgets are identified by a name that must be unique</p>
<p>
<b>Company</b> = The owner of the new uncertainty budget. The new budget(s) are accessible to any user within that company.</p>
<p>
<b>Std Dev Used When Statistically Zero</b> = This value is used to overruled (overwrite) any standard deviation equal to zero. For example Medjil uses the sample standard deviation of observation sets composed of measurements between the same pillars to calculate an uncertainty of the EDMI measurements. When all measurements in the one observation set are the same or if there is only one measurement in the observation set, the sample standard deviation is mathematically zero.</p>
<p>
<b>Type</b> = Definition of uncertainty type. Type A means a statistically derived component or uncertainty where Type B stands for any other derivation of uncertainty e.g. calibration report, manufacturer's specification or an estimate based on experience.</p>
<p>
<b>Distribution</b> = Definition of distribution associated with the uncertainty. A normal distribution is most associated with continuous univariate distributions such as many random variables. 
A rectangular distribution represents an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bound (equal probability anywhere within the range). For example rounding of a physical quantity or a resolution of digital instrument.</p>
<p>
<b>Uncertainty</b> = The expanded uncertainty at 95% confidence in the units specified for the uncertainty source.</p>
<p>
<b>K</b> = The coverage factor used to scale and expand the uncertainty from one standard deviation (68% confidence) to 95% confidence level. Typically 2.0 for a normal distribution or sqrt(3) for a rectangular distribution. Medjil will auto complete this field as the distribution drop-down is changed but the user still has the ability to overwrite this field.</p>
<p>
<b>Dof</b> = Degrees of freedom. For a Type A uncertainty this is equal to the number of measurements minus the number of unknowns (redundant measurements). For a Type B uncertainty Dof needs to be estimated. The following can be used as a guide: 3 for not very confident, 10 for moderate confidence, 30 for very confident.</p>
<p>
<b>Group</b> = Uncertainty sources are categorised into 11 different groups. The group selected for an uncertainty source will affect the following:</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>The combining of error sources in the calibration report</li>
<li>The unit selection for this uncertainty source</li>
<li>The propagation (contribution) of the error sources to the total uncertainty of the calibration</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>EDM scale factor</b> = Uncertainty related to the EDM scale factor can be specified in parts per million (ppm), percent (%), scalar(x:1) or a ratio (1:x). All error sources belonging to this group will be combined before the contribution to the total uncertainty of the calibration according to the following formula:</p>
<div>$$ su_d = D*csu_g\ \ \ (Eq. 4.12)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;su<sub>d</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D = Distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;csu<sub>g</sub> = Combined standard uncertainty of the group</p>
<p>The 'Default' Uncertainty Budget lists an error source with the description 'EDM scale factor affected by Temp (Type B)'. The EDM scale factor can be affected by temperature. This uncertainty component is a Type B estimate based on previous knowledge.</p>
<p>
<b>EDMI measurement</b> = Uncertainty relating to the EDMI measurement can be specified in metres (m), millimetres (mm), parts per million (ppm), percent (%), scalar(x:1) or a ratio (1:x). All error sources belonging to this group will be combined before the contribution to the total uncertainty of the calibration according to the following formula:</p>
<div>$$ su_d = csu_g\ \ \ (Eq. 4.13)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;su<sub>d</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;csu<sub>g</sub> = Combined standard uncertainty of the group</p>
<p>
<b>EDM LS zero offset</b> = Uncertainty relating to the EDM Least Squares zero offset can be specified in metres (m) or millimetres (mm). All error sources belonging to this group will be combined before the contribution to the total uncertainty of the calibration according to the following formula 4.13</p>
<p>
<b>Temperature</b> = Uncertainty related to the temperature can be specified in degrees Celsius (°C) or degrees Fahrenheit (°F). All error sources belonging to this group will be combined before the contribution to the total uncertainty of the calibration according to the following formula:</p>
<div>$$ su_d = D*K*csu_g*10^{-6}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.14)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;su<sub>d</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D = Distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;csu<sub>g</sub> = Combined standard uncertainty of the group</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;K = Partial differential for temperature defined as:</p>
<div>$$ K=\left[\frac{\frac{\left(n_G-1\right)\left(273.15p\right)}{1013.25}-11.27e*{10}^{-6}}{273.15+t^2}\right]*{10}^6\ \ \ (Eq. 4.15)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;p = Pressure [hPa]</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;t = Temperature [C]</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;n<sub>G</sub> = Manufacturers reference refractive index </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;e = Partial water vapour Pressure [hPa] defined as:</p>
<div>$$ e=\frac{Eh}{100}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.16)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;E = Saturation water vapour [hPa] at the dry bulb temperature</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;h = Relative humidity [%]</p>
<p>
<b>Pressure</b> = Uncertainty related to the presure can be specified in millibars (mBar), hectopascals (hPa) or millimetres of mercury (mmHg). All error sources belonging to this group will be combined before the contribution to the total uncertainty of the calibration according to the following formula:</p>
<div>$$ su_d = D*L*csu_g*10^{-6}\ \ \ (Eq. 4.17)$$ </div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;su<sub>d</sub> = Standard uncertainty of the distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;D = Distance</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;csu<sub>g</sub> = Combined standard uncertainty of the group</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;L = Partial differential for Pressure defined as:</p>
<div>$$ L=\left[0.26957809\frac{\left(n_G-1\right)}{273.15+t^2}\right]\ast{10}^6\ \ \ (Eq. 4.18)$$ </div>
<p>
<b>Humidity</b> = Uncertainty relating to the humidity must be specified as a percent (%). All error sources belonging to this group will be combined before the contribution to the total uncertainty of the calibration according to the following formula:</p>

<p>The following tests assume a confidence level of 1 − α = 0.95 (95%) and a number of degrees of freedom (ν) based on number of redundant measurements.</p>
<div id="Chapter_6_1_1"></div>
<h3>6.1.1 Hypothesis A</h3>
<p>This null hypothesis states that the calculated experimental standard deviation, s, is smaller than or equal to the manufacturers specifications value &sigma;.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is not rejected if the following condition is fulfilled:</p>
<div>$$ s_0\le\sigma\times\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{1-\alpha}^2(\nu)}{\nu}}\ \ \ \ (Eq. 6.1) $$</div>
<p>Otherwise, the null hypothesis is rejected.</p>
<div id="Chapter_6_1_2"></div>
<h3>6.1.2 Hypothesis B</h3>
<p>The null hypothesis states that the experimental standard deviation, s belong to the same population as the standard deviation (&#x3B5;&#x303;) obtained in the previous calibrations using the same instrumentation.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is not rejected if the following condition is fulfilled:</p>
<div>$$ \frac{1}{F_{1-\alpha/2}\left(v,v\right)}\le\frac{s_0^2}{{\widetilde{\varepsilon}}_0^2}\le F_{1-\alpha/2}\left(v,v\right)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 6.2) $$</div>
<p>Otherwise, the null hypothesis is rejected.</p>
<div id="Chapter_6_1_3"></div>
<h3>6.1.3 Hypothesis C</h3>
<p>The null hypothesis states that the zero-point correction, δ, is equal to zero as supplied by the manufacturer (δ = 0)? Or, if prisms with a given zero-point correction, δ<sub>0</sub> are used, is δ = δ<sub>0</sub>?</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is not rejected if the following condition is fulfilled:</p>
<div>$$ |δ-δ_0 |≤s_δ×t_{1-α/2} (ν)\ \ \ \ (Eq. 6.3) $$</div>
<p>Otherwise, the null hypothesis is rejected.</p>
