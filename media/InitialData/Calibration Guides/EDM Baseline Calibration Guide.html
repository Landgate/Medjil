<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>Under the Licensed Surveyors (General Surveying Practice) Regulations 1961, regulation 20, the Surveyor General is to arrange for a standard or standards to be available to enable surveyors to comply with sub regulation 20(1). This sub regulation requires a surveyor to calibrate measuring equipment at regular intervals, not exceeding 2 years, and in accordance with acceptable practices.

The Surveyor General has tasked Survey Services with providing the standards and acceptable practices enabling a surveyor to be able to comply with regulation 20.

This procedure shall be applied whenever Landgate calibrates the Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton EDM baselines (standards).</p>

<h1>2. Procedure</h1>
<h2>2.1 Request a job to calibrate baselines</h2>
<p>Curtin, Kalgoorlie and Busselton EDM baselines are calibrated every 2 years. The last date of calibration can be found on the current Regulation 13 certificate (see GS7/88/33). A geodetic job number is to be created for each of the baseline. </p>

<p>High precision EDMI (EDM and prism) must be used to calibrate the EDM baselines. The EDMI must be calibrated by an accredited NATA laboratory and requires a current Regulation 13 certificate. 
Baseline measurements must be performed in accordance with the ISO17123-4:2012 Optics and optical instruments – Field procedures for testing geodetic and surveying instruments – Part 4: Electro-optical distance meters (EDM measurements to reflectors).</p> 
<p>The following EDMI should be used to calibrate EDM baselines:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>TS30 s/n 364182 and GPH1P prism s/n 100</li>
</ul>

<p>A current calibration report is also required for all meteorological instruments used in the process of EDM baselines calibration. These instruments are to be calibrated externally by an accredited NATA laboratory. he following meteorological instruments should be used to calibrate EDM baselines:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Temperature and relative humidity meter s/n 21002807</li>
<li>Temperature and relative humidity meter s/n 21002811</li>
<li>Barometer s/n 74003848</li>
<li>Barometer s/n 11945508</li>
</ul>

<p>External calibrations are to be undertaken in accordance with CAL-02 document.</p>
<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason: Maintains legal traceability of equipment for baseline calibration.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.3 Measure baselines</h2>
<p>Prior to any EDM baseline calibration a notice (email) must be forwarded to the Land Surveyors Licensing Board for it to inform all relevant institutions and practicing licensed surveyors that the relevant EDM baseline will be closed between certain dates due to calibration activities.</p>

<p>All observation should commence only after the daily temperatures have stabilised. Temperature should not fluctuate more than 10ºC.</p>

<p>The instrument is initially set up on pillar 1 and the prism on pillar 2. An umbrella must shade the EDM instrument and meteorological instruments. The height of the EDM instrument and prism are measured and recorded at each pillar.</p>

<p>Meteorological observations of pressure, relative humidity and temperature are recorded for each distance measured. These measurements should be taken at the instrument and prism. Ensure meteorological equipment has stabilised before making observations.</p>

<p>Meteorological observations should not fall outside of the range for which the instrument has been calibrated. Below are the current ranges.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Temperature: +10 to +40ºC</li>
<li>Pressure: 750.00 to 1150mbars</li>
<li>Relative Humidity: 11 to 75 %RH</li>
</ul>

<p>Meteorological observations and the instrument and prism heights are entered into the EDM instrument. A minimum of four distances are measured at each setup and the prism is moved progressively through all pillars. The EDM instrument is then moved to pillar 2 and the prism is moved back through all pillars to pillar 1, measuring in the above manner. This process is repeated until the EDM instrument has occupied all pillars.</p>

<p>Short distances of 10 metres were not measured prior to 2021, however these distances are now observed.</p>

<p>The pillar alignment and height differences must be verified. All observations are recorded digitally and manually on booking sheets. Observations to be signed and stored by geodesist in an ECAL folder.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason: Observe data to compute the new baseline distances.</li>
<li>Output:  Completed observation booking sheets and digital file.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.4  EDM calibration for interlaboratory comparison</h2>
<p>After completing the EDM baseline calibration observations as per 2.3, an independent EDM Baseline measurements are to be undertaken for the purpose of interlaboratory comparison. The same instrument must be used for all interlaboratory comparisons undertaken at each baseline.</p>
<p>The following instrument and prism must be used for the interlaboratory comparison:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason: Observe data to compute the new baseline distances.</li>
</ul>
<h1>S16 s/n 3012827 and GPH1P prism s/n 100</h1>
<p>This EDM calibration is to be undertaken in accordance with CAL-03.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:  Capture data for evaluation of calibrations. Ref ISO 17025:2017 7.2.2.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.5 Import observations into the EDM Baseline calibration portal</h2>
<p>Prior to importing, the EDM baseline observations must be corrected by the values provided in the Table 2 (results of measurement) of the NMI calibration report. Only the corrected observations are then imported into the "Baseline calibration" portal for processing to determine the new certified distances and uncertainties of the EDM Baseline.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:  Computation of Certified EDM Baseline distances.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.6 Data entry QA</h2>
<p>All data must is verified by the Senior Geodesist (or another Senior Property Location Officer) by comparing a hardcopy print of the input data with the original baseline booking sheets.</p>

<p>Any errors found must be corrected before the computation.</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:  Data QA control.</li>
<li>Position: Senior Geodesist</li>
</ul>

<p>Inspect the calibration report and certificate and compare the new certified distances against the previous certified distances. Large residuals may indicate pillar movement or an error in the calibration process. If differences between new and previous certified distances are found included in the final report potential reason for the difference (e.g. pillar movement).</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Reason:   Ensures no gross errors and/or pillar movement.</li>
<li>Position: Geodesist</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.8 Estimate uncertainty of distances</h2>
<p>The estimation of uncertainty is to be considered in conjunction with ISO 17123:4.</p>
<p>The estimated EDM baseline distances are influenced by the following sources of uncertainty:</p>

<ul STYLE="margin:30px">
<li>Uncertainty of the EDM measurement</li>
<li>Atmospheric measurements</li>
<li>Error patterns from mechanical setup</li>
<li>Eounding error quantities</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table lists the error budget used for the calculation of uncertainty of EDM Baseline's distances:</p>
